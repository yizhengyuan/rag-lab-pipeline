Numerous\nefforts have since continued to push the boundaries of recurrent language models and encoder-decoder\narchitectures [38, 24, 15].\nRecurrent models typically factor computation along the symbol positions of the input and output\nsequences. Aligning the positions to steps in computation time, they generate a sequence of hidden\nstates ht, as a function of the previous hidden state ht−1and the input for position t. This inherently\nsequential nature precludes parallelization within training examples, which becomes critical at longer\nsequence lengths, as memory constraints limit batching across examples. Recent work has achieved\nsignificant improvements in computational efficiency through factorization tricks [ 21] and conditional\ncomputation [ 32], while also improving model performance in case of the latter. The fundamental\nconstraint of sequential computation, however, remains.\nAttention mechanisms have become an integral part of compelling sequence modeling and transduc-\ntion models in various tasks, allowing modeling of dependencies without regard to their distance in\nthe input or output sequences [ 2,19]. In all but a few cases [ 27], however, such attention mechanisms\nare used in conjunction with a recurrent network.\nIn this work we propose the Transformer, a model architecture eschewing recurrence and instead\nrelying entirely on an attention mechanism to draw global dependencies between input and output.\nThe Transformer allows for significantly more parallelization and can reach a new state of the art in\ntranslation quality after being trained for as little as twelve hours on eight P100 GPUs.\n2 Background\nThe goal of reducing sequential computation also forms the foundation of the Extended Neural GPU\n[16], ByteNet [ 18] and ConvS2S [ 9], all of which use convolutional neural networks as basic building\nblock, computing hidden representations in parallel for all input and output positions. In these models,\nthe number of operations required to relate signals from two arbitrary input or output positions grows\nin the distance between positions, linearly for ConvS2S and logarithmically for ByteNet. This makes\nit more difficult to learn dependencies between distant positions [ 12]. In the Transformer this is\nreduced to a constant number of operations, albeit at the cost of reduced effective resolution due\nto averaging attention-weighted positions, an effect we counteract with Multi-Head Attention as\ndescribed in section 3.2.\nSelf-attention, sometimes called intra-attention is an attention mechanism relating different positions\nof a single sequence in order to compute a representation of the sequence. Self-attention has been\nused successfully in a variety of tasks including reading comprehension, abstractive summarization,\ntextual entailment and learning task-independent sentence representations [4, 27, 28, 22].\nEnd-to-end memory networks are based on a recurrent attention mechanism instead of sequence-\naligned recurrence and have been shown to perform well on simple-language question answering and\nlanguage modeling tasks [34].\nTo the best of our knowledge, however, the Transformer is the first transduction model relying\nentirely on self-attention to compute representations of its input and output without using sequence-\naligned RNNs or convolution. In the following sections, we will describe the Transformer, motivate\nself-attention and discuss its advantages over models such as [17, 18] and [9].\n3 Model Architecture\nMost competitive neural sequence transduction models have an encoder-decoder structure [ 5,2,35].\nHere, the encoder maps an input sequence of symbol representations (x1, ..., x n)to a sequence\nof continuous representations z= (z1, ..., z n). Given z, the decoder then generates an output\nsequence (y1, ..., y m)of symbols one element at a time. At each step the model is auto-regressive\n[10], consuming the previously generated symbols as additional input when generating the next.\n2\nFigure 1: The Transformer - model architecture.\nThe Transformer follows this overall architecture using stacked self-attention and point-wise, fully\nconnected layers for both the encoder and decoder, shown in the left and right halves of Figure 1,\nrespectively.\n3.1 Encoder and Decoder Stacks\nEncoder: The encoder is composed of a stack of N= 6 identical layers. Each layer has two\nsub-layers. The first is a multi-head self-attention mechanism, and the second is a simple, position-\nwise fully connected feed-forward network. We employ a residual connection [ 11] around each of\nthe two sub-layers, followed by layer normalization [ 1]. That is, the output of each sub-layer is\nLayerNorm( x+ Sublayer( x)), where Sublayer( x)is the function implemented by the sub-layer\nitself. To facilitate these residual connections, all sub-layers in the model, as well as the embedding\nlayers, produce outputs of dimension dmodel = 512 .\nDecoder: The decoder is also composed of a stack of N= 6identical layers. In addition to the two\nsub-layers in each encoder layer, the decoder inserts a third sub-layer, which performs multi-head\nattention over the output of the encoder stack. Similar to the encoder, we employ residual connections\naround each of the sub-layers, followed by layer normalization. We also modify the self-attention\nsub-layer in the decoder stack to prevent positions from attending to subsequent positions. This\nmasking, combined with fact that the output embeddings are offset by one position, ensures that the\npredictions for position ican depend only on the known outputs at positions less than i.\n3.2 Attention\nAn attention function can be described as mapping a query and a set of key-value pairs to an output,\nwhere the query, keys, values, and output are all vectors. The output is computed as a weighted sum\n3\nScaled Dot-Product Attention\nMulti-Head Attention\nFigure 2: (left) Scaled Dot-Product Attention. (right) Multi-Head Attention consists of several\nattention layers running in parallel.\nof the values, where the weight assigned to each value is computed by a compatibility function of the\nquery with the corresponding key.\n3.2.1 Scaled Dot-Product Attention\nWe call our particular attention \"Scaled Dot-Product Attention\" (Figure 2). The input consists of\nqueries and keys of dimension dk, and values of dimension dv. We compute the dot products of the\nquery with all keys, divide each by√dk, and apply a softmax function to obtain the weights on the\nvalues.\nIn practice, we compute the attention function on a set of queries simultaneously, packed together\ninto a matrix Q. The keys and values are also packed together into matrices KandV. We compute\nthe matrix of outputs as:\nAttention( Q, K, V ) = softmax(QKT\n√dk)V (1)\nThe two most commonly used attention functions are additive attention [ 2], and dot-product (multi-\nplicative) attention. Dot-product attention is identical to our algorithm, except for the scaling factor\nof1√dk. Additive attention computes the compatibility function using a feed-forward network with\na single hidden layer. While the two are similar in theoretical complexity, dot-product attention is\nmuch faster and more space-efficient in practice, since it can be implemented using highly optimized\nmatrix multiplication code.\nWhile for small values of dkthe two mechanisms perform similarly, additive attention outperforms\ndot product attention without scaling for larger values of dk[3]. We suspect that for large values of\ndk, the dot products grow large in magnitude, pushing the softmax function into regions where it has\nextremely small gradients4. To counteract this effect, we scale the dot products by1√dk.\n3.2.2 Multi-Head Attention\nInstead of performing a single attention function with dmodel-dimensional keys, values and queries,\nwe found it beneficial to linearly project the queries, keys and values htimes with different, learned\nlinear projections to dk,dkanddvdimensions, respectively. On each of these projected versions of\nqueries, keys and values we then perform the attention function in parallel, yielding dv-dimensional\n4To illustrate why the dot products get large, assume that the components of qandkare independent random\nvariables with mean 0and variance 1. Then their dot product, q·k=Pdk\ni=1qiki, has mean 0and variance dk.\n4\noutput values. These are concatenated and once again projected, resulting in the final values, as\ndepicted in Figure 2.\nMulti-head attention allows the model to jointly attend to information from different representation\nsubspaces at different positions. With a single attention head, averaging inhibits this.\nMultiHead( Q, K, V ) = Concat(head 1, ...,head h)WO\nwhere head i= Attention( QWQ\ni, KWK\ni, V WV\ni)\nWhere the projections are parameter matrices WQ\ni∈Rdmodel×dk,WK\ni∈Rdmodel×dk,WV\ni∈Rdmodel×dv\nandWO∈Rhdv×dmodel.\nIn this work we employ h= 8 parallel attention layers, or heads. For each of these we use\ndk=dv=dmodel/h= 64 . Due to the reduced dimension of each head, the total computational cost\nis similar to that of single-head attention with full dimensionality.\n3.2.3 Applications of Attention in our Model\nThe Transformer uses multi-head attention in three different ways:\n•In \"encoder-decoder attention\" layers, the queries come from the previous decoder layer,\nand the memory keys and values come from the output of the encoder. This allows every\nposition in the decoder to attend over all positions in the input sequence. This mimics the\ntypical encoder-decoder attention mechanisms in sequence-to-sequence models such as\n[38, 2, 9].\n•The encoder contains self-attention layers. In a self-attention layer all of the keys, values\nand queries come from the same place, in this case, the output of the previous layer in the\nencoder. Each position in the encoder can attend to all positions in the previous layer of the\nencoder.\n•Similarly, self-attention layers in the decoder allow each position in the decoder to attend to\nall positions in the decoder up to and including that position. We need to prevent leftward\ninformation flow in the decoder to preserve the auto-regressive property. We implement this\ninside of scaled dot-product attention by masking out (setting to −∞) all values in the input\nof the softmax which correspond to illegal connections. See Figure 2.\n3.3 Position-wise Feed-Forward Networks\nIn addition to attention sub-layers, each of the layers in our encoder and decoder contains a fully\nconnected feed-forward network, which is applied to each position separately and identically. This\nconsists of two linear transformations with a ReLU activation in between.\nFFN( x) = max(0 , xW 1+b1)W2+b2 (2)\nWhile the linear transformations are the same across different positions, they use different parameters\nfrom layer to layer. Another way of describing this is as two convolutions with kernel size 1.\nThe dimensionality of input and output is dmodel = 512 , and the inner-layer has dimensionality\ndff= 2048 .\n3.4 Embeddings and Softmax\nSimilarly to other sequence transduction models, we use learned embeddings to convert the input\ntokens and output tokens to vectors of dimension dmodel. We also use the usual learned linear transfor-\nmation and softmax function to convert the decoder output to predicted next-token probabilities. In\nour model, we share the same weight matrix between the two embedding layers and the pre-softmax\nlinear transformation, similar to [ 30]. In the embedding layers, we multiply those weights by√dmodel.\n5\nTable 1: Maximum path lengths, per-layer complexity and minimum number of sequential operations\nfor different layer types. nis the sequence length, dis the representation dimension, kis the kernel\nsize of convolutions and rthe size of the neighborhood in restricted self-attention.\nLayer Type Complexity per Layer Sequential Maximum Path Length\nOperations\nSelf-Attention O(n2·d) O(1) O(1)\nRecurrent O(n·d2) O(n) O(n)\nConvolutional O(k·n·d2) O(1) O(logk(n))\nSelf-Attention (restricted) O(r·n·d) O(1) O(n/r)\n3.5 Positional Encoding\nSince our model contains no recurrence and no convolution, in order for the model to make use of the\norder of the sequence, we must inject some information about the relative or absolute position of the\ntokens in the sequence. To this end, we add \"positional encodings\" to the input embeddings at the\nbottoms of the encoder and decoder stacks. The positional encodings have the same dimension dmodel\nas the embeddings, so that the two can be summed. There are many choices of positional encodings,\nlearned and fixed [9].\nIn this work, we use sine and cosine functions of different frequencies:\nPE(pos,2i)=sin(pos/100002i/d model)\nPE(pos,2i+1)=cos(pos/100002i/d model)\nwhere posis the position and iis the dimension. That is, each dimension of the positional encoding\ncorresponds to a sinusoid. The wavelengths form a geometric progression from 2πto10000 ·2π. We\nchose this function because we hypothesized it would allow the model to easily learn to attend by\nrelative positions, since for any fixed offset k,PEpos+kcan be represented as a linear function of\nPEpos.\nWe also experimented with using learned positional embeddings [ 9] instead, and found that the two\nversions produced nearly identical results (see Table 3 row (E)). We chose the sinusoidal version\nbecause it may allow the model to extrapolate to sequence lengths longer than the ones encountered\nduring training.\n4 Why Self-Attention\nIn this section we compare various aspects of self-attention layers to the recurrent and convolu-\ntional layers commonly used for mapping one variable-length sequence of symbol representations\n(x1, ..., x n)to another sequence of equal length (z1, ..., z n), with xi, zi∈Rd, such as a hidden\nlayer in a typical sequence transduction encoder or decoder. Motivating our use of self-attention we\nconsider three desiderata.\nOne is the total computational complexity per layer. Another is the amount of computation that can\nbe parallelized, as measured by the minimum number of sequential operations required.\nThe third is the path length between long-range dependencies in the network. Learning long-range\ndependencies is a key challenge in many sequence transduction tasks. One key factor affecting the\nability to learn such dependencies is the length of the paths forward and backward signals have to\ntraverse in the network. The shorter these paths between any combination of positions in the input\nand output sequences, the easier it is to learn long-range dependencies [ 12]. Hence we also compare\nthe maximum path length between any two input and output positions in networks composed of the\ndifferent layer types.\nAs noted in Table 1, a self-attention layer connects all positions with a constant number of sequentially\nexecuted operations, whereas a recurrent layer requires O(n)sequential operations. In terms of\ncomputational complexity, self-attention layers are faster than recurrent layers when the sequence\n6\nlength nis smaller than the representation dimensionality d, which is most often the case with\nsentence representations used by state-of-the-art models in machine translations, such as word-piece\n[38] and byte-pair [ 31] representations. To improve computational performance for tasks involving\nvery long sequences, self-attention could be restricted to considering only a neighborhood of size rin\nthe input sequence centered around the respective output position. This would increase the maximum\npath length to O(n/r). We plan to investigate this approach further in future work.\nA single convolutional layer with kernel width k < n does not connect all pairs of input and output\npositions. Doing so requires a stack of O(n/k)convolutional layers in the case of contiguous kernels,\norO(logk(n))in the case of dilated convolutions [ 18], increasing the length of the longest paths\nbetween any two positions in the network. Convolutional layers are generally more expensive than\nrecurrent layers, by a factor of k. Separable convolutions [ 6], however, decrease the complexity\nconsiderably, to O(k·n·d+n·d2). Even with k=n, however, the complexity of a separable\nconvolution is equal to the combination of a self-attention layer and a point-wise feed-forward layer,\nthe approach we take in our model.\nAs side benefit, self-attention could yield more interpretable models. We inspect attention distributions\nfrom our models and present and discuss examples in the appendix. Not only do individual attention\nheads clearly learn to perform different tasks, many appear to exhibit behavior related to the syntactic\nand semantic structure of the sentences.\n5 Training\nThis section describes the training regime for our models.\n5.1 Training Data and Batching\nWe trained on the standard WMT 2014 English-German dataset consisting of about 4.5 million\nsentence pairs. Sentences were encoded using byte-pair encoding [ 3], which has a shared source-\ntarget vocabulary of about 37000 tokens. For English-French, we used the significantly larger WMT\n2014 English-French dataset consisting of 36M sentences and split tokens into a 32000 word-piece\nvocabulary [ 38]. Sentence pairs were batched together by approximate sequence length. Each training\nbatch contained a set of sentence pairs containing approximately 25000 source tokens and 25000\ntarget tokens.\n5.2 Hardware and Schedule\nWe trained our models on one machine with 8 NVIDIA P100 GPUs. For our base models using\nthe hyperparameters described throughout the paper, each training step took about 0.4 seconds. We\ntrained the base models for a total of 100,000 steps or 12 hours. For our big models,(described on the\nbottom line of table 3), step time was 1.0 seconds. The big models were trained for 300,000 steps\n(3.5 days).\n5.3 Optimizer\nWe used the Adam optimizer [ 20] with β1= 0.9,β2= 0.98andϵ= 10−9. We varied the learning\nrate over the course of training, according to the formula:\nlrate =d−0.5\nmodel·min(step_num−0.5, step _num·warmup _steps−1.5) (3)\nThis corresponds to increasing the learning rate linearly for the first warmup _steps training steps,\nand decreasing it thereafter proportionally to the inverse square root of the step number. We used\nwarmup _steps = 4000 .\n5.4 Regularization\nWe employ three types of regularization during training:\n7\nTable 2: The Transformer achieves better BLEU scores than previous state-of-the-art models on the\nEnglish-to-German and English-to-French newstest2014 tests at a fraction of the training cost.\nModelBLEU Training Cost (FLOPs)\nEN-DE EN-FR EN-DE EN-FR\nByteNet [18] 23.75\nDeep-Att + PosUnk [39] 39.2 1.0·1020\nGNMT + RL [38] 24.6 39.92 2.3·10191.4·1020\nConvS2S [9] 25.16 40.46 9.6·10181.5·1020\nMoE [32] 26.03 40.56 2.0·10191.2·1020\nDeep-Att + PosUnk Ensemble [39] 40.4 8.0·1020\nGNMT + RL Ensemble [38] 26.30 41.16 1.8·10201.1·1021\nConvS2S Ensemble [9] 26.36 41.29 7.7·10191.2·1021\nTransformer (base model) 27.3 38.1 3.3·1018\nTransformer (big) 28.4 41.8 2.3·1019\nResidual Dropout We apply dropout [ 33] to the output of each sub-layer, before it is added to the\nsub-layer input and normalized. In addition, we apply dropout to the sums of the embeddings and the\npositional encodings in both the encoder and decoder stacks. For the base model, we use a rate of\nPdrop= 0.1.\nLabel Smoothing During training, we employed label smoothing of value ϵls= 0.1[36]. This\nhurts perplexity, as the model learns to be more unsure, but improves accuracy and BLEU score.\n6 Results\n6.1 Machine Translation\nOn the WMT 2014 English-to-German translation task, the big transformer model (Transformer (big)\nin Table 2) outperforms the best previously reported models (including ensembles) by more than 2.0\nBLEU, establishing a new state-of-the-art BLEU score of 28.4. The configuration of this model is\nlisted in the bottom line of Table 3. Training took 3.5days on 8P100 GPUs. Even our base model\nsurpasses all previously published models and ensembles, at a fraction of the training cost of any of\nthe competitive models.\nOn the WMT 2014 English-to-French translation task, our big model achieves a BLEU score of 41.0,\noutperforming all of the previously published single models, at less than 1/4the training cost of the\nprevious state-of-the-art model. The Transformer (big) model trained for English-to-French used\ndropout rate Pdrop= 0.1, instead of 0.3.\nFor the base models, we used a single model obtained by averaging the last 5 checkpoints, which\nwere written at 10-minute intervals. For the big models, we averaged the last 20 checkpoints. We\nused beam search with a beam size of 4and length penalty α= 0.6[38]. These hyperparameters\nwere chosen after experimentation on the development set. We set the maximum output length during\ninference to input length + 50, but terminate early when possible [38].\nTable 2 summarizes our results and compares our translation quality and training costs to other model\narchitectures from the literature. We estimate the number of floating point operations used to train a\nmodel by multiplying the training time, the number of GPUs used, and an estimate of the sustained\nsingle-precision floating-point capacity of each GPU5.\n6.2 Model Variations\nTo evaluate the importance of different components of the Transformer, we varied our base model\nin different ways, measuring the change in performance on English-to-German translation on the\n5We used values of 2.8, 3.7, 6.0 and 9.5 TFLOPS for K80, K40, M40 and P100, respectively.\n8\nTable 3: Variations on the Transformer architecture. Unlisted values are identical to those of the base\nmodel. All metrics are on the English-to-German translation development set, newstest2013. Listed\nperplexities are per-wordpiece, according to our byte-pair encoding, and should not be compared to\nper-word perplexities.\nN d model dff h d k dvPdrop ϵlstrain PPL BLEU params\nsteps (dev) (dev) ×106\nbase 6 512 2048 8 64 64 0.1 0.1 100K 4.92 25.8 65\n(A)1 512 512 5.29 24.9\n4 128 128 5.00 25.5\n16 32 32 4.91 25.8\n32 16 16 5.01 25.4\n(B)16 5.16 25.1 58\n32 5.01 25.4 60\n(C)2 6.11 23.7 36\n4 5.19 25.3 50\n8 4.88 25.5 80\n256 32 32 5.75 24.5 28\n1024 128 128 4.66 26.0 168\n1024 5.12 25.4 53\n4096 4.75 26.2 90\n(D)0.0 5.77 24.6\n0.2 4.95 25.5\n0.0 4.67 25.3\n0.2 5.47 25.7\n(E) positional embedding instead of sinusoids 4.92 25.7\nbig 6 1024 4096 16 0.3 300K 4.33 26.4 213\ndevelopment set, newstest2013. We used beam search as described in the previous section, but no\ncheckpoint averaging. We present these results in Table 3.\nIn Table 3 rows (A), we vary the number of attention heads and the attention key and value dimensions,\nkeeping the amount of computation constant, as described in Section 3.2.2. While single-head\nattention is 0.9 BLEU worse than the best setting, quality also drops off with too many heads.\nIn Table 3 rows (B), we observe that reducing the attention key size dkhurts model quality. This\nsuggests that determining compatibility is not easy and that a more sophisticated compatibility\nfunction than dot product may be beneficial. We further observe in rows (C) and (D) that, as expected,\nbigger models are better, and dropout is very helpful in avoiding over-fitting. In row (E) we replace our\nsinusoidal positional encoding with learned positional embeddings [ 9], and observe nearly identical\nresults to the base model.\n6.3 English Constituency Parsing\nTo evaluate if the Transformer can generalize to other tasks we performed experiments on English\nconstituency parsing. This task presents specific challenges: the output is subject to strong structural\nconstraints and is significantly longer than the input. Furthermore, RNN sequence-to-sequence\nmodels have not been able to attain state-of-the-art results in small-data regimes [37].\nWe trained a 4-layer transformer with dmodel = 1024 on the Wall Street Journal (WSJ) portion of the\nPenn Treebank [ 25], about 40K training sentences. We also trained it in a semi-supervised setting,\nusing the larger high-confidence and BerkleyParser corpora from with approximately 17M sentences\n[37]. We used a vocabulary of 16K tokens for the WSJ only setting and a vocabulary of 32K tokens\nfor the semi-supervised setting.\nWe performed only a small number of experiments to select the dropout, both attention and residual\n(section 5.4), learning rates and beam size on the Section 22 development set, all other parameters\nremained unchanged from the English-to-German base translation model. During inference, we\n9\nTable 4: The Transformer generalizes well to English constituency parsing (Results are on Section 23\nof WSJ)\nParser Training WSJ 23 F1\nVinyals & Kaiser el al.

We used a beam size of 21andα= 0.3\nfor both WSJ only and the semi-supervised setting.\nOur results in Table 4 show that despite the lack of task-specific tuning our model performs sur-\nprisingly well, yielding better results than all previously reported models with the exception of the\nRecurrent Neural Network Grammar [8].\nIn contrast to RNN sequence-to-sequence models [ 37], the Transformer outperforms the Berkeley-\nParser [29] even when training only on the WSJ training set of 40K sentences.\n7 Conclusion\nIn this work, we presented the Transformer, the first sequence transduction model based entirely on\nattention, replacing the recurrent layers most commonly used in encoder-decoder architectures with\nmulti-headed self-attention.\nFor translation tasks, the Transformer can be trained significantly faster than architectures based\non recurrent or convolutional layers. On both WMT 2014 English-to-German and WMT 2014\nEnglish-to-French translation tasks, we achieve a new state of the art. In the former task our best\nmodel outperforms even all previously reported ensembles.\nWe are excited about the future of attention-based models and plan to apply them to other tasks. We\nplan to extend the Transformer to problems involving input and output modalities other than text and\nto investigate local, restricted attention mechanisms to efficiently handle large inputs and outputs\nsuch as images, audio and video. Making generation less sequential is another research goals of ours.\nThe code we used to train and evaluate our models is available at https://github.com/\ntensorflow/tensor2tensor .\nAcknowledgements We are grateful to Nal Kalchbrenner and Stephan Gouws for their fruitful\ncomments, corrections and inspiration.\nReferences\n[1]Jimmy Lei Ba, Jamie Ryan Kiros, and Geoffrey E Hinton.

The best\nperforming models also connect the encoder and decoder through an attention\nmechanism. We propose a new simple network architecture, the Transformer,\nbased solely on attention mechanisms, dispensing with recurrence and convolutions\nentirely. Experiments on two machine translation tasks show these models to\nbe superior in quality while being more parallelizable and requiring significantly\nless time to train. Our model achieves 28.4 BLEU on the WMT 2014 English-\nto-German translation task, improving over the existing best results, including\nensembles, by over 2 BLEU. On the WMT 2014 English-to-French translation task,\nour model establishes a new single-model state-of-the-art BLEU score of 41.8 after\ntraining for 3.5 days on eight GPUs, a small fraction of the training costs of the\nbest models from the literature. We show that the Transformer generalizes well to\nother tasks by applying it successfully to English constituency parsing both with\nlarge and limited training data.\n∗Equal contribution. ",

          "text": "Recurrent models typically factor computation along the symbol positions of the input and output\nsequences. Aligning the positions to steps in computation time, they generate a sequence of hidden\nstates ht, as a function of the previous hidden state ht−1and the input for position t. This inherently\nsequential nature precludes parallelization within training examples, which becomes critical at longer\nsequence lengths, as memory constraints limit batching across examples. Recent work has achieved\nsignificant improvements in computational efficiency through factorization tricks [ 21] and conditional\ncomputation [ 32], while also improving model performance in case of the latter. The fundamental\nconstraint of sequential computation, however, remains.\nAttention mechanisms have become an integral part of compelling sequence modeling and transduc-\ntion models in various tasks, allowing modeling of dependencies without regard to their distance in\nthe input or output sequences [ 2,19]. In all but a few cases [ 27], however, such attention mechanisms\nare used in conjunction with a recurrent network.\nIn this work we propose the Transformer, a model architecture eschewing recurrence and instead\nrelying entirely on an attention mechanism to draw global dependencies between input and output.\nThe Transformer allows for significantly more parallelization and can reach a new state of the art in\ntranslation quality after being trained for as little as twelve hours on eight P100 GPUs.\n2 Background\nThe goal of reducing sequential computation also forms the foundation of the Extended Neural GPU\n[16], ByteNet [ 18] and ConvS2S [ 9], all of which use convolutional neural networks as basic building\nblock, computing hidden representations in parallel for all input and output positions. In these models,\nthe number of operations required to relate signals from two arbitrary input or output positions grows\nin the distance between positions, linearly for ConvS2S and logarithmically for ByteNet. This makes\nit more difficult to learn dependencies between distant positions [ 12]. In the Transformer this is\nreduced to a constant number of operations, albeit at the cost of reduced effective resolution due\nto averaging attention-weighted positions, an effect we counteract with Multi-Head Attention as\ndescribed in section 3.2.\nSelf-attention, sometimes called intra-attention is an attention mechanism relating different positions\nof a single sequence in order to compute a representation of the sequence. Self-attention has been\nused successfully in a variety of tasks including reading comprehension, abstractive summarization,\ntextual entailment and learning task-independent sentence representations [4, 27, 28, 22].\nEnd-to-end memory networks are based on a recurrent attention mechanism instead of sequence-\naligned recurrence and have been shown to perform well on simple-language question answering and\nlanguage modeling tasks [34].\nTo the best of our knowledge, however, the Transformer is the first transduction model relying\nentirely on self-attention to compute representations of its input and output without using sequence-\naligned RNNs or convolution. In the following sections, we will describe the Transformer, motivate\nself-attention and discuss its advantages over models such as [17, 18] and [9].\n3 Model Architecture\nMost competitive neural sequence transduction models have an encoder-decoder structure [ 5,2,35].\nHere, the encoder maps an input sequence of symbol representations (x1, ..., x n)to a sequence\nof continuous representations z= (z1, ..., z n). Given z, the decoder then generates an output\nsequence (y1, ..., y m)of symbols one element at a time. At each step the model is auto-regressive\n[10], consuming the previously generated symbols as additional input when generating the next.\n2\nFigure 1: The Transformer - model architecture.\nThe Transformer follows this overall architecture using stacked self-attention and point-wise, fully\nconnected layers for both the encoder and decoder, shown in the left and right halves of Figure 1,\nrespectively.\n3.1 Encoder and Decoder Stacks\nEncoder: The encoder is composed of a stack of N= 6 identical layers. Each layer has two\nsub-layers. The first is a multi-head self-attention mechanism, and the second is a simple, position-\nwise fully connected feed-forward network. We employ a residual connection [ 11] around each of\nthe two sub-layers, followed by layer normalization [ 1]. That is, the output of each sub-layer is\nLayerNorm( x+ Sublayer( x)), where Sublayer( x)is the function implemented by the sub-layer\nitself. To facilitate these residual connections, all sub-layers in the model, as well as the embedding\nlayers, produce outputs of dimension dmodel = 512 .\nDecoder: The decoder is also composed of a stack of N= 6identical layers. In addition to the two\nsub-layers in each encoder layer, the decoder inserts a third sub-layer, which performs multi-head\nattention over the output of the encoder stack. Similar to the encoder, we employ residual connections\naround each of the sub-layers, followed by layer normalization. We also modify the self-attention\nsub-layer in the decoder stack to prevent positions from attending to subsequent positions. This\nmasking, combined with fact that the output embeddings are offset by one position, ensures that the\npredictions for position ican depend only on the known outputs at positions less than i.\n3.2 Attention\nAn attention function can be described as mapping a query and a set of key-value pairs to an output,\nwhere the query, keys, values, and output are all vectors. The output is computed as a weighted sum\n3\nScaled Dot-Product Attention\nMulti-Head Attention\nFigure 2: (left) Scaled Dot-Product Attention. (right) Multi-Head Attention consists of several\nattention layers running in parallel.\nof the values, where the weight assigned to each value is computed by a compatibility function of the\nquery with the corresponding key.\n3.2.1 Scaled Dot-Product Attention\nWe call our particular attention \"Scaled Dot-Product Attention\" (Figure 2). The input consists of\nqueries and keys of dimension dk, and values of dimension dv. We compute the dot products of the\nquery with all keys, divide each by√dk, and apply a softmax function to obtain the weights on the\nvalues.\nIn practice, we compute the attention function on a set of queries simultaneously, packed together\ninto a matrix Q. The keys and values are also packed together into matrices KandV. We compute\nthe matrix of outputs as:\nAttention( Q, K, V ) = softmax(QKT\n√dk)V (1)\nThe two most commonly used attention functions are additive attention [ 2], and dot-product (multi-\nplicative) attention. Dot-product attention is identical to our algorithm, except for the scaling factor\nof1√dk. Additive attention computes the compatibility function using a feed-forward network with\na single hidden layer. While the two are similar in theoretical complexity, dot-product attention is\nmuch faster and more space-efficient in practice, since it can be implemented using highly optimized\nmatrix multiplication code.\nWhile for small values of dkthe two mechanisms perform similarly, additive attention outperforms\ndot product attention without scaling for larger values of dk[3]. We suspect that for large values of\ndk, the dot products grow large in magnitude, pushing the softmax function into regions where it has\nextremely small gradients4. To counteract this effect, we scale the dot products by1√dk.\n3.2.2 Multi-Head Attention\nInstead of performing a single attention function with dmodel-dimensional keys, values and queries,\nwe found it beneficial to linearly project the queries, keys and values htimes with different, learned\nlinear projections to dk,dkanddvdimensions, respectively. On each of these projected versions of\nqueries, keys and values we then perform the attention function in parallel, yielding dv-dimensional\n4To illustrate why the dot products get large, assume that the components of qandkare independent random\nvariables with mean 0and variance 1. Then their dot product, q·k=Pdk\ni=1qiki, has mean 0and variance dk.\n4\noutput values. ",

Due to the reduced dimension of each head, the total computational cost\nis similar to that of single-head attention with full dimensionality.\n3.2.3 Applications of Attention in our Model\nThe Transformer uses multi-head attention in three different ways:\n•In \"encoder-decoder attention\" layers, the queries come from the previous decoder layer,\nand the memory keys and values come from the output of the encoder. This allows every\nposition in the decoder to attend over all positions in the input sequence. This mimics the\ntypical encoder-decoder attention mechanisms in sequence-to-sequence models such as\n[38, 2, 9].\n•The encoder contains self-attention layers. In a self-attention layer all of the keys, values\nand queries come from the same place, in this case, the output of the previous layer in the\nencoder. Each position in the encoder can attend to all positions in the previous layer of the\nencoder.\n•Similarly, self-attention layers in the decoder allow each position in the decoder to attend to\nall positions in the decoder up to and including that position. We need to prevent leftward\ninformation flow in the decoder to preserve the auto-regressive property. We implement this\ninside of scaled dot-product attention by masking out (setting to −∞) all values in the input\nof the softmax which correspond to illegal connections. See Figure 2.\n3.3 Position-wise Feed-Forward Networks\nIn addition to attention sub-layers, each of the layers in our encoder and decoder contains a fully\nconnected feed-forward network, which is applied to each position separately and identically. This\nconsists of two linear transformations with a ReLU activation in between.\nFFN( x) = max(0 , xW 1+b1)W2+b2 (2)\nWhile the linear transformations are the same across different positions, they use different parameters\nfrom layer to layer. Another way of describing this is as two convolutions with kernel size 1.\n",

We also use the usual learned linear transfor-\nmation and softmax function to convert the decoder output to predicted next-token probabilities. In\nour model, we share the same weight matrix between the two embedding layers and the pre-softmax\nlinear transformation, similar to [ 30]. In the embedding layers, we multiply those weights by√dmodel.\n5\nTable 1: Maximum path lengths, per-layer complexity and minimum number of sequential operations\nfor different layer types. nis the sequence length, dis the representation dimension, kis the kernel\nsize of convolutions and rthe size of the neighborhood in restricted self-attention.\nLayer Type Complexity per Layer Sequential Maximum Path Length\nOperations\nSelf-Attention O(n2·d) O(1) O(1)\nRecurrent O(n·d2) O(n) O(n)\nConvolutional O(k·n·d2) O(1) O(logk(n))\nSelf-Attention (restricted) O(r·n·d) O(1) O(n/r)\n3.5 Positional Encoding\nSince our model contains no recurrence and no convolution, in order for the model to make use of the\norder of the sequence, we must inject some information about the relative or absolute position of the\ntokens in the sequence. To this end, we add \"positional encodings\" to the input embeddings at the\nbottoms of the encoder and decoder stacks. The positional encodings have the same dimension dmodel\nas the embeddings, so that the two can be summed. There are many choices of positional encodings,\nlearned and fixed [9].\nIn this work, we use sine and cosine functions of different frequencies:\nPE(pos,2i)=sin(pos/100002i/d model)\nPE(pos,2i+1)=cos(pos/100002i/d model)\nwhere posis the position and iis the dimension. That is, each dimension of the positional encoding\ncorresponds to a sinusoid. The wavelengths form a geometric progression from 2πto10000 ·2π. We\nchose this function because we hypothesized it would allow the model to easily learn to attend by\nrelative positions, since for any fixed offset k,PEpos+kcan be represented as a linear function of\nPEpos.\nWe also experimented with using learned positional embeddings [ 9] instead, and found that the two\nversions produced nearly identical results (see Table 3 row (E)). We chose the sinusoidal version\nbecause it may allow the model to extrapolate to sequence lengths longer than the ones encountered\nduring training.\n4 Why Self-Attention\nIn this section we compare various aspects of self-attention layers to the recurrent and convolu-\ntional layers commonly used for mapping one variable-length sequence of symbol representations\n(x1, ..., x n)to another sequence of equal length (z1, ..., z n), with xi, zi∈Rd, such as a hidden\nlayer in a typical sequence transduction encoder or decoder. Motivating our use of self-attention we\nconsider three desiderata.\nOne is the total computational complexity per layer. Another is the amount of computation that can\nbe parallelized, as measured by the minimum number of sequential operations required.\nThe third is the path length between long-range dependencies in the network. Learning long-range\ndependencies is a key challenge in many sequence transduction tasks. One key factor affecting the\nability to learn such dependencies is the length of the paths forward and backward signals have to\ntraverse in the network. The shorter these paths between any combination of positions in the input\nand output sequences, the easier it is to learn long-range dependencies [ 12]. Hence we also compare\nthe maximum path length between any two input and output positions in networks composed of the\ndifferent layer types.\nAs noted in Table 1, a self-attention layer connects all positions with a constant number of sequentially\nexecuted operations, whereas a recurrent layer requires O(n)sequential operations. In terms of\ncomputational complexity, self-attention layers are faster than recurrent layers when the sequence\n6\nlength nis smaller than the representation dimensionality d, which is most often the case with\nsentence representations used by state-of-the-art models in machine translations, such as word-piece\n[38] and byte-pair [ 31] representations. To improve computational performance for tasks involving\nvery long sequences, self-attention could be restricted to considering only a neighborhood of size rin\nthe input sequence centered around the respective output position. This would increase the maximum\npath length to O(n/r). We plan to investigate this approach further in future work.\nA single convolutional layer with kernel width k < n does not connect all pairs of input and output\npositions. Doing so requires a stack of O(n/k)convolutional layers in the case of contiguous kernels,\norO(logk(n))in the case of dilated convolutions [ 18], increasing the length of the longest paths\nbetween any two positions in the network. Convolutional layers are generally more expensive than\nrecurrent layers, by a factor of k. Separable convolutions [ 6], however, decrease the complexity\nconsiderably, to O(k·n·d+n·d2). Even with k=n, however, the complexity of a separable\nconvolution is equal to the combination of a self-attention layer and a point-wise feed-forward layer,\nthe approach we take in our model.\nAs side benefit, self-attention could yield more interpretable models.

Sentences were encoded using byte-pair encoding [ 3], which has a shared source-\ntarget vocabulary of about 37000 tokens.

Sentence pairs were batched together by approximate sequence length.

For our base models using\nthe hyperparameters described throughout the paper, each training step took about 0.4 seconds. We\ntrained the base models for a total of 100,000 steps or 12 hours. For our big models,(described on the\nbottom line of table 3), step time was 1.0 seconds. The big models were trained for 300,000 steps\n(3.5 days).\n5.3 Optimizer\nWe used the Adam optimizer [ 20] with β1= 0.9,β2= 0.98andϵ= 10−9. We varied the learning\nrate over the course of training, according to the formula:\nlrate =d−0.5\nmodel·min(step_num−0.5, step _num·warmup _steps−1.5) (3)\nThis corresponds to increasing the learning rate linearly for the first warmup _steps training steps,\nand decreasing it thereafter proportionally to the inverse square root of the step number.

While single-head\nattention is 0.9 BLEU worse than the best setting, quality also drops off with too many heads.\nIn Table 3 rows (B), we observe that reducing the attention key size dkhurts model quality. This\nsuggests that determining compatibility is not easy and that a more sophisticated compatibility\nfunction than dot product may be beneficial. We further observe in rows (C) and (D) that, as expected,\nbigger models are better, and dropout is very helpful in avoiding over-fitting. In row (E) we replace our\nsinusoidal positional encoding with learned positional embeddings [ 9], and observe nearly identical\nresults to the base model.\n6.3 English Constituency Parsing\nTo evaluate if the Transformer can generalize to other tasks we performed experiments on English\nconstituency parsing. This task presents specific challenges: the output is subject to strong structural\nconstraints and is significantly longer than the input. Furthermore, RNN sequence-to-sequence\nmodels have not been able to attain state-of-the-art results in small-data regimes [37].\nWe trained a 4-layer transformer with dmodel = 1024 on the Wall Street Journal (WSJ) portion of the\nPenn Treebank [ 25], about 40K training sentences. We also trained it in a semi-supervised setting,\nusing the larger high-confidence and BerkleyParser corpora from with approximately 17M sentences\n[37]. We used a vocabulary of 16K tokens for the WSJ only setting and a vocabulary of 32K tokens\nfor the semi-supervised setting.\nWe performed only a small number of experiments to select the dropout, both attention and residual\n(section 5.4), learning rates and beam size on the Section 22 development set, all other parameters\nremained unchanged from the English-to-German base translation model.

On both WMT 2014 English-to-German and WMT 2014\nEnglish-to-French translation tasks, we achieve a new state of the art. In the former task our best\nmodel outperforms even all previously reported ensembles.\nWe are excited about the future of attention-based models and plan to apply them to other tasks. We\nplan to extend the Transformer to problems involving input and output modalities other than text and\nto investigate local, restricted attention mechanisms to efficiently handle large inputs and outputs\nsuch as images, audio and video. Making generation less sequential is another research goals of ours.\nThe code we used to train and evaluate our models is available at https://github.com/\ntensorflow/tensor2tensor .\nAcknowledgements We are grateful to Nal Kalchbrenner and Stephan Gouws for their fruitful\ncomments, corrections and inspiration.\nReferences\n[1]Jimmy Lei Ba, Jamie Ryan Kiros, and Geoffrey E Hinton.

Our model achieves 28.4 BLEU on the WMT 2014 English-\nto-German translation task, improving over the existing best results, including\nensembles, by over 2 BLEU. On the WMT 2014 English-to-French translation task,\nour model establishes a new single-model state-of-the-art BLEU score of 41.8 after\ntraining for 3.5 days on eight GPUs, a small fraction of the training costs of the\nbest models from the literature.

Numerous\nefforts have since continued to push the boundaries of recurrent language models and encoder-decoder\narchitectures [38, 24, 15].\nRecurrent models typically factor computation along the symbol positions of the input and output\nsequences. Aligning the positions to steps in computation time, they generate a sequence of hidden\nstates ht, as a function of the previous hidden state ht−1and the input for position t. This inherently\nsequential nature precludes parallelization within training examples, which becomes critical at longer\nsequence lengths, as memory constraints limit batching across examples. Recent work has achieved\nsignificant improvements in computational efficiency through factorization tricks [ 21] and conditional\ncomputation [ 32], while also improving model performance in case of the latter. The fundamental\nconstraint of sequential computation, however, remains.\nAttention mechanisms have become an integral part of compelling sequence modeling and transduc-\ntion models in various tasks, allowing modeling of dependencies without regard to their distance in\nthe input or output sequences [ 2,19]. In all but a few cases [ 27], however, such attention mechanisms\nare used in conjunction with a recurrent network.\nIn this work we propose the Transformer, a model architecture eschewing recurrence and instead\nrelying entirely on an attention mechanism to draw global dependencies between input and output.\nThe Transformer allows for significantly more parallelization and can reach a new state of the art in\ntranslation quality after being trained for as little as twelve hours on eight P100 GPUs.\n2 Background\nThe goal of reducing sequential computation also forms the foundation of the Extended Neural GPU\n[16], ByteNet [ 18] and ConvS2S [ 9], all of which use convolutional neural networks as basic building\nblock, computing hidden representations in parallel for all input and output positions. In these models,\nthe number of operations required to relate signals from two arbitrary input or output positions grows\nin the distance between positions, linearly for ConvS2S and logarithmically for ByteNet. This makes\nit more difficult to learn dependencies between distant positions [ 12]. In the Transformer this is\nreduced to a constant number of operations, albeit at the cost of reduced effective resolution due\nto averaging attention-weighted positions, an effect we counteract with Multi-Head Attention as\ndescribed in section 3.2.\nSelf-attention, sometimes called intra-attention is an attention mechanism relating different positions\nof a single sequence in order to compute a representation of the sequence. Self-attention has been\nused successfully in a variety of tasks including reading comprehension, abstractive summarization,\ntextual entailment and learning task-independent sentence representations [4, 27, 28, 22].\nEnd-to-end memory networks are based on a recurrent attention mechanism instead of sequence-\naligned recurrence and have been shown to perform well on simple-language question answering and\nlanguage modeling tasks [34].\nTo the best of our knowledge, however, the Transformer is the first transduction model relying\nentirely on self-attention to compute representations of its input and output without using sequence-\naligned RNNs or convolution. In the following sections, we will describe the Transformer, motivate\nself-attention and discuss its advantages over models such as [17, 18] and [9].\n3 Model Architecture\nMost competitive neural sequence transduction models have an encoder-decoder structure [ 5,2,35].\nHere, the encoder maps an input sequence of symbol representations (x1, ..., x n)to a sequence\nof continuous representations z= (z1, ..., z n). Given z, the decoder then generates an output\nsequence (y1, ..., y m)of symbols one element at a time. At each step the model is auto-regressive\n[10], consuming the previously generated symbols as additional input when generating the next.\n2\nFigure 1: The Transformer - model architecture.\nThe Transformer follows this overall architecture using stacked self-attention and point-wise, fully\nconnected layers for both the encoder and decoder, shown in the left and right halves of Figure 1,\nrespectively.\n3.1 Encoder and Decoder Stacks\nEncoder: The encoder is composed of a stack of N= 6 identical layers. Each layer has two\nsub-layers. The first is a multi-head self-attention mechanism, and the second is a simple, position-\nwise fully connected feed-forward network. We employ a residual connection [ 11] around each of\nthe two sub-layers, followed by layer normalization [ 1]. That is, the output of each sub-layer is\nLayerNorm( x+ Sublayer( x)), where Sublayer( x)is the function implemented by the sub-layer\nitself. To facilitate these residual connections, all sub-layers in the model, as well as the embedding\nlayers, produce outputs of dimension dmodel = 512 .\nDecoder: The decoder is also composed of a stack of N= 6identical layers. In addition to the two\nsub-layers in each encoder layer, the decoder inserts a third sub-layer, which performs multi-head\nattention over the output of the encoder stack. Similar to the encoder, we employ residual connections\naround each of the sub-layers, followed by layer normalization. We also modify the self-attention\nsub-layer in the decoder stack to prevent positions from attending to subsequent positions. This\nmasking, combined with fact that the output embeddings are offset by one position, ensures that the\npredictions for position ican depend only on the known outputs at positions less than i.\n3.2 Attention\nAn attention function can be described as mapping a query and a set of key-value pairs to an output,\nwhere the query, keys, values, and output are all vectors. The output is computed as a weighted sum\n3\nScaled Dot-Product Attention\nMulti-Head Attention\nFigure 2: (left) Scaled Dot-Product Attention. (right) Multi-Head Attention consists of several\nattention layers running in parallel.\nof the values, where the weight assigned to each value is computed by a compatibility function of the\nquery with the corresponding key.\n3.2.1 Scaled Dot-Product Attention\nWe call our particular attention \"Scaled Dot-Product Attention\" (Figure 2). The input consists of\nqueries and keys of dimension dk, and values of dimension dv. We compute the dot products of the\nquery with all keys, divide each by√dk, and apply a softmax function to obtain the weights on the\nvalues.\nIn practice, we compute the attention function on a set of queries simultaneously, packed together\ninto a matrix Q. The keys and values are also packed together into matrices KandV. We compute\nthe matrix of outputs as:\nAttention( Q, K, V ) = softmax(QKT\n√dk)V (1)\nThe two most commonly used attention functions are additive attention [ 2], and dot-product (multi-\nplicative) attention. Dot-product attention is identical to our algorithm, except for the scaling factor\nof1√dk. Additive attention computes the compatibility function using a feed-forward network with\na single hidden layer. While the two are similar in theoretical complexity, dot-product attention is\nmuch faster and more space-efficient in practice, since it can be implemented using highly optimized\nmatrix multiplication code.\nWhile for small values of dkthe two mechanisms perform similarly, additive attention outperforms\ndot product attention without scaling for larger values of dk[3]. We suspect that for large values of\ndk, the dot products grow large in magnitude, pushing the softmax function into regions where it has\nextremely small gradients4. To counteract this effect, we scale the dot products by1√dk.\n3.2.2 Multi-Head Attention\nInstead of performing a single attention function with dmodel-dimensional keys, values and queries,\nwe found it beneficial to linearly project the queries, keys and values htimes with different, learned\nlinear projections to dk,dkanddvdimensions, respectively. On each of these projected versions of\nqueries, keys and values we then perform the attention function in parallel, yielding dv-dimensional\n4To illustrate why the dot products get large, assume that the components of qandkare independent random\nvariables with mean 0and variance 1. Then their dot product, q·k=Pdk\ni=1qiki, has mean 0and variance dk.\n4\noutput values. These are concatenated and once again projected, resulting in the final values, as\ndepicted in Figure 2.\nMulti-head attention allows the model to jointly attend to information from different representation\nsubspaces at different positions. With a single attention head, averaging inhibits this.\nMultiHead( Q, K, V ) = Concat(head 1, ...,head h)WO\nwhere head i= Attention( QWQ\ni, KWK\ni, V WV\ni)\nWhere the projections are parameter matrices WQ\ni∈Rdmodel×dk,WK\ni∈Rdmodel×dk,WV\ni∈Rdmodel×dv\nandWO∈Rhdv×dmodel.\nIn this work we employ h= 8 parallel attention layers, or heads. For each of these we use\ndk=dv=dmodel/h= 64 . Due to the reduced dimension of each head, the total computational cost\nis similar to that of single-head attention with full dimensionality.\n3.2.3 Applications of Attention in our Model\nThe Transformer uses multi-head attention in three different ways:\n•In \"encoder-decoder attention\" layers, the queries come from the previous decoder layer,\nand the memory keys and values come from the output of the encoder. This allows every\nposition in the decoder to attend over all positions in the input sequence. This mimics the\ntypical encoder-decoder attention mechanisms in sequence-to-sequence models such as\n[38, 2, 9].\n•The encoder contains self-attention layers. In a self-attention layer all of the keys, values\nand queries come from the same place, in this case, the output of the previous layer in the\nencoder. Each position in the encoder can attend to all positions in the previous layer of the\nencoder.\n•Similarly, self-attention layers in the decoder allow each position in the decoder to attend to\nall positions in the decoder up to and including that position. We need to prevent leftward\ninformation flow in the decoder to preserve the auto-regressive property. We implement this\ninside of scaled dot-product attention by masking out (setting to −∞) all values in the input\nof the softmax which correspond to illegal connections. See Figure 2.\n3.3 Position-wise Feed-Forward Networks\nIn addition to attention sub-layers, each of the layers in our encoder and decoder contains a fully\nconnected feed-forward network, which is applied to each position separately and identically. This\nconsists of two linear transformations with a ReLU activation in between.\nFFN( x) = max(0 , xW 1+b1)W2+b2 (2)\nWhile the linear transformations are the same across different positions, they use different parameters\nfrom layer to layer. Another way of describing this is as two convolutions with kernel size 1.\nThe dimensionality of input and output is dmodel = 512 , and the inner-layer has dimensionality\ndff= 2048 .\n3.4 Embeddings and Softmax\nSimilarly to other sequence transduction models, we use learned embeddings to convert the input\ntokens and output tokens to vectors of dimension dmodel. We also use the usual learned linear transfor-\nmation and softmax function to convert the decoder output to predicted next-token probabilities. In\nour model, we share the same weight matrix between the two embedding layers and the pre-softmax\nlinear transformation, similar to [ 30]. In the embedding layers, we multiply those weights by√dmodel.\n5\nTable 1: Maximum path lengths, per-layer complexity and minimum number of sequential operations\nfor different layer types. nis the sequence length, dis the representation dimension, kis the kernel\nsize of convolutions and rthe size of the neighborhood in restricted self-attention.\nLayer Type Complexity per Layer Sequential Maximum Path Length\nOperations\nSelf-Attention O(n2·d) O(1) O(1)\nRecurrent O(n·d2) O(n) O(n)\nConvolutional O(k·n·d2) O(1) O(logk(n))\nSelf-Attention (restricted) O(r·n·d) O(1) O(n/r)\n3.5 Positional Encoding\nSince our model contains no recurrence and no convolution, in order for the model to make use of the\norder of the sequence, we must inject some information about the relative or absolute position of the\ntokens in the sequence. To this end, we add \"positional encodings\" to the input embeddings at the\nbottoms of the encoder and decoder stacks. The positional encodings have the same dimension dmodel\nas the embeddings, so that the two can be summed. There are many choices of positional encodings,\nlearned and fixed [9].\nIn this work, we use sine and cosine functions of different frequencies:\nPE(pos,2i)=sin(pos/100002i/d model)\nPE(pos,2i+1)=cos(pos/100002i/d model)\nwhere posis the position and iis the dimension. That is, each dimension of the positional encoding\ncorresponds to a sinusoid. The wavelengths form a geometric progression from 2πto10000 ·2π. We\nchose this function because we hypothesized it would allow the model to easily learn to attend by\nrelative positions, since for any fixed offset k,PEpos+kcan be represented as a linear function of\nPEpos.\nWe also experimented with using learned positional embeddings [ 9] instead, and found that the two\nversions produced nearly identical results (see Table 3 row (E)). We chose the sinusoidal version\nbecause it may allow the model to extrapolate to sequence lengths longer than the ones encountered\nduring training.\n4 Why Self-Attention\nIn this section we compare various aspects of self-attention layers to the recurrent and convolu-\ntional layers commonly used for mapping one variable-length sequence of symbol representations\n(x1, ..., x n)to another sequence of equal length (z1, ..., z n), with xi, zi∈Rd, such as a hidden\nlayer in a typical sequence transduction encoder or decoder. Motivating our use of self-attention we\nconsider three desiderata.\nOne is the total computational complexity per layer. Another is the amount of computation that can\nbe parallelized, as measured by the minimum number of sequential operations required.\nThe third is the path length between long-range dependencies in the network. Learning long-range\ndependencies is a key challenge in many sequence transduction tasks. One key factor affecting the\nability to learn such dependencies is the length of the paths forward and backward signals have to\ntraverse in the network. The shorter these paths between any combination of positions in the input\nand output sequences, the easier it is to learn long-range dependencies [ 12]. Hence we also compare\nthe maximum path length between any two input and output positions in networks composed of the\ndifferent layer types.\nAs noted in Table 1, a self-attention layer connects all positions with a constant number of sequentially\nexecuted operations, whereas a recurrent layer requires O(n)sequential operations. In terms of\ncomputational complexity, self-attention layers are faster than recurrent layers when the sequence\n6\nlength nis smaller than the representation dimensionality d, which is most often the case with\nsentence representations used by state-of-the-art models in machine translations, such as word-piece\n[38] and byte-pair [ 31] representations. To improve computational performance for tasks involving\nvery long sequences, self-attention could be restricted to considering only a neighborhood of size rin\nthe input sequence centered around the respective output position. This would increase the maximum\npath length to O(n/r). We plan to investigate this approach further in future work.\nA single convolutional layer with kernel width k < n does not connect all pairs of input and output\npositions. Doing so requires a stack of O(n/k)convolutional layers in the case of contiguous kernels,\norO(logk(n))in the case of dilated convolutions [ 18], increasing the length of the longest paths\nbetween any two positions in the network. Convolutional layers are generally more expensive than\nrecurrent layers, by a factor of k. Separable convolutions [ 6], however, decrease the complexity\nconsiderably, to O(k·n·d+n·d2). Even with k=n, however, the complexity of a separable\nconvolution is equal to the combination of a self-attention layer and a point-wise feed-forward layer,\nthe approach we take in our model.\nAs side benefit, self-attention could yield more interpretable models. We inspect attention distributions\nfrom our models and present and discuss examples in the appendix. Not only do individual attention\nheads clearly learn to perform different tasks, many appear to exhibit behavior related to the syntactic\nand semantic structure of the sentences.\n5 Training\nThis section describes the training regime for our models.\n5.1 Training Data and Batching\nWe trained on the standard WMT 2014 English-German dataset consisting of about 4.5 million\nsentence pairs. Sentences were encoded using byte-pair encoding [ 3], which has a shared source-\ntarget vocabulary of about 37000 tokens. For English-French, we used the significantly larger WMT\n2014 English-French dataset consisting of 36M sentences and split tokens into a 32000 word-piece\nvocabulary [ 38]. Sentence pairs were batched together by approximate sequence length. Each training\nbatch contained a set of sentence pairs containing approximately 25000 source tokens and 25000\ntarget tokens.\n5.2 Hardware and Schedule\nWe trained our models on one machine with 8 NVIDIA P100 GPUs. For our base models using\nthe hyperparameters described throughout the paper, each training step took about 0.4 seconds. We\ntrained the base models for a total of 100,000 steps or 12 hours. For our big models,(described on the\nbottom line of table 3), step time was 1.0 seconds. The big models were trained for 300,000 steps\n(3.5 days).\n5.3 Optimizer\nWe used the Adam optimizer [ 20] with β1= 0.9,β2= 0.98andϵ= 10−9. We varied the learning\nrate over the course of training, according to the formula:\nlrate =d−0.5\nmodel·min(step_num−0.5, step _num·warmup _steps−1.5) (3)\nThis corresponds to increasing the learning rate linearly for the first warmup _steps training steps,\nand decreasing it thereafter proportionally to the inverse square root of the step number. We used\nwarmup _steps = 4000 .\n5.4 Regularization\nWe employ three types of regularization during training:\n7\nTable 2: The Transformer achieves better BLEU scores than previous state-of-the-art models on the\nEnglish-to-German and English-to-French newstest2014 tests at a fraction of the training cost.\nModelBLEU Training Cost (FLOPs)\nEN-DE EN-FR EN-DE EN-FR\nByteNet [18] 23.75\nDeep-Att + PosUnk [39] 39.2 1.0·1020\nGNMT + RL [38] 24.6 39.92 2.3·10191.4·1020\nConvS2S [9] 25.16 40.46 9.6·10181.5·1020\nMoE [32] 26.03 40.56 2.0·10191.2·1020\nDeep-Att + PosUnk Ensemble [39] 40.4 8.0·1020\nGNMT + RL Ensemble [38] 26.30 41.16 1.8·10201.1·1021\nConvS2S Ensemble [9] 26.36 41.29 7.7·10191.2·1021\nTransformer (base model) 27.3 38.1 3.3·1018\nTransformer (big) 28.4 41.8 2.3·1019\nResidual Dropout We apply dropout [ 33] to the output of each sub-layer, before it is added to the\nsub-layer input and normalized. In addition, we apply dropout to the sums of the embeddings and the\npositional encodings in both the encoder and decoder stacks. For the base model, we use a rate of\nPdrop= 0.1.\nLabel Smoothing During training, we employed label smoothing of value ϵls= 0.1[36]. This\nhurts perplexity, as the model learns to be more unsure, but improves accuracy and BLEU score.\n6 Results\n6.1 Machine Translation\nOn the WMT 2014 English-to-German translation task, the big transformer model (Transformer (big)\nin Table 2) outperforms the best previously reported models (including ensembles) by more than 2.0\nBLEU, establishing a new state-of-the-art BLEU score of 28.4. The configuration of this model is\nlisted in the bottom line of Table 3. Training took 3.5days on 8P100 GPUs. Even our base model\nsurpasses all previously published models and ensembles, at a fraction of the training cost of any of\nthe competitive models.\nOn the WMT 2014 English-to-French translation task, our big model achieves a BLEU score of 41.0,\noutperforming all of the previously published single models, at less than 1/4the training cost of the\nprevious state-of-the-art model. The Transformer (big) model trained for English-to-French used\ndropout rate Pdrop= 0.1, instead of 0.3.\nFor the base models, we used a single model obtained by averaging the last 5 checkpoints, which\nwere written at 10-minute intervals. For the big models, we averaged the last 20 checkpoints. We\nused beam search with a beam size of 4and length penalty α= 0.6[38]. These hyperparameters\nwere chosen after experimentation on the development set. We set the maximum output length during\ninference to input length + 50, but terminate early when possible [38].\nTable 2 summarizes our results and compares our translation quality and training costs to other model\narchitectures from the literature. We estimate the number of floating point operations used to train a\nmodel by multiplying the training time, the number of GPUs used, and an estimate of the sustained\nsingle-precision floating-point capacity of each GPU5.\n6.2 Model Variations\nTo evaluate the importance of different components of the Transformer, we varied our base model\nin different ways, measuring the change in performance on English-to-German translation on the\n5We used values of 2.8, 3.7, 6.0 and 9.5 TFLOPS for K80, K40, M40 and P100, respectively.\n8\nTable 3: Variations on the Transformer architecture. Unlisted values are identical to those of the base\nmodel. All metrics are on the English-to-German translation development set, newstest2013.

We used beam search as described in the previous section, but no\ncheckpoint averaging. We present these results in Table 3.\nIn Table 3 rows (A), we vary the number of attention heads and the attention key and value dimensions,\nkeeping the amount of computation constant, as described in Section 3.2.2. While single-head\nattention is 0.9 BLEU worse than the best setting, quality also drops off with too many heads.\nIn Table 3 rows (B), we observe that reducing the attention key size dkhurts model quality. This\nsuggests that determining compatibility is not easy and that a more sophisticated compatibility\nfunction than dot product may be beneficial. We further observe in rows (C) and (D) that, as expected,\nbigger models are better, and dropout is very helpful in avoiding over-fitting. In row (E) we replace our\nsinusoidal positional encoding with learned positional embeddings [ 9], and observe nearly identical\nresults to the base model.\n6.3 English Constituency Parsing\nTo evaluate if the Transformer can generalize to other tasks we performed experiments on English\nconstituency parsing. This task presents specific challenges: the output is subject to strong structural\nconstraints and is significantly longer than the input. Furthermore, RNN sequence-to-sequence\nmodels have not been able to attain state-of-the-art results in small-data regimes [37].\nWe trained a 4-layer transformer with dmodel = 1024 on the Wall Street Journal (WSJ) portion of the\nPenn Treebank [ 25], about 40K training sentences. We also trained it in a semi-supervised setting,\nusing the larger high-confidence and BerkleyParser corpora from with approximately 17M sentences\n[37]. We used a vocabulary of 16K tokens for the WSJ only setting and a vocabulary of 32K tokens\nfor the semi-supervised setting.\nWe performed only a small number of experiments to select the dropout, both attention and residual\n(section 5.4), learning rates and beam size on the Section 22 development set, all other parameters\nremained unchanged from the English-to-German base translation model. During inference, we\n9\nTable 4: The Transformer generalizes well to English constituency parsing (Results are on Section 23\nof WSJ)\nParser Training WSJ 23 F1\nVinyals & Kaiser el al.

We used a beam size of 21andα= 0.3\nfor both WSJ only and the semi-supervised setting.\nOur results in Table 4 show that despite the lack of task-specific tuning our model performs sur-\nprisingly well, yielding better results than all previously reported models with the exception of the\nRecurrent Neural Network Grammar [8].\nIn contrast to RNN sequence-to-sequence models [ 37], the Transformer outperforms the Berkeley-\nParser [29] even when training only on the WSJ training set of 40K sentences.\n7 Conclusion\nIn this work, we presented the Transformer, the first sequence transduction model based entirely on\nattention, replacing the recurrent layers most commonly used in encoder-decoder architectures with\nmulti-headed self-attention.\nFor translation tasks, the Transformer can be trained significantly faster than architectures based\non recurrent or convolutional layers. On both WMT 2014 English-to-German and WMT 2014\nEnglish-to-French translation tasks, we achieve a new state of the art. In the former task our best\nmodel outperforms even all previously reported ensembles.\nWe are excited about the future of attention-based models and plan to apply them to other tasks. We\nplan to extend the Transformer to problems involving input and output modalities other than text and\nto investigate local, restricted attention mechanisms to efficiently handle large inputs and outputs\nsuch as images, audio and video. Making generation less sequential is another research goals of ours.\nThe code we used to train and evaluate our models is available at https://github.com/\ntensorflow/tensor2tensor .\nAcknowledgements We are grateful to Nal Kalchbrenner and Stephan Gouws for their fruitful\ncomments, corrections and inspiration.\nReferences\n[1]Jimmy Lei Ba, Jamie Ryan Kiros, and Geoffrey E Hinton.

The best\nperforming models also connect the encoder and decoder through an attention\nmechanism. We propose a new simple network architecture, the Transformer,\nbased solely on attention mechanisms, dispensing with recurrence and convolutions\nentirely. Experiments on two machine translation tasks show these models to\nbe superior in quality while being more parallelizable and requiring significantly\nless time to train. Our model achieves 28.4 BLEU on the WMT 2014 English-\nto-German translation task, improving over the existing best results, including\nensembles, by over 2 BLEU. On the WMT 2014 English-to-French translation task,\nour model establishes a new single-model state-of-the-art BLEU score of 41.8 after\ntraining for 3.5 days on eight GPUs, a small fraction of the training costs of the\nbest models from the literature. We show that the Transformer generalizes well to\nother tasks by applying it successfully to English constituency parsing both with\nlarge and limited training data.\n∗Equal contribution. ",

          "text": "Recurrent models typically factor computation along the symbol positions of the input and output\nsequences. Aligning the positions to steps in computation time, they generate a sequence of hidden\nstates ht, as a function of the previous hidden state ht−1and the input for position t. This inherently\nsequential nature precludes parallelization within training examples, which becomes critical at longer\nsequence lengths, as memory constraints limit batching across examples. Recent work has achieved\nsignificant improvements in computational efficiency through factorization tricks [ 21] and conditional\ncomputation [ 32], while also improving model performance in case of the latter. The fundamental\nconstraint of sequential computation, however, remains.\nAttention mechanisms have become an integral part of compelling sequence modeling and transduc-\ntion models in various tasks, allowing modeling of dependencies without regard to their distance in\nthe input or output sequences [ 2,19]. In all but a few cases [ 27], however, such attention mechanisms\nare used in conjunction with a recurrent network.\nIn this work we propose the Transformer, a model architecture eschewing recurrence and instead\nrelying entirely on an attention mechanism to draw global dependencies between input and output.\nThe Transformer allows for significantly more parallelization and can reach a new state of the art in\ntranslation quality after being trained for as little as twelve hours on eight P100 GPUs.\n2 Background\nThe goal of reducing sequential computation also forms the foundation of the Extended Neural GPU\n[16], ByteNet [ 18] and ConvS2S [ 9], all of which use convolutional neural networks as basic building\nblock, computing hidden representations in parallel for all input and output positions. In these models,\nthe number of operations required to relate signals from two arbitrary input or output positions grows\nin the distance between positions, linearly for ConvS2S and logarithmically for ByteNet. This makes\nit more difficult to learn dependencies between distant positions [ 12]. In the Transformer this is\nreduced to a constant number of operations, albeit at the cost of reduced effective resolution due\nto averaging attention-weighted positions, an effect we counteract with Multi-Head Attention as\ndescribed in section 3.2.\nSelf-attention, sometimes called intra-attention is an attention mechanism relating different positions\nof a single sequence in order to compute a representation of the sequence. Self-attention has been\nused successfully in a variety of tasks including reading comprehension, abstractive summarization,\ntextual entailment and learning task-independent sentence representations [4, 27, 28, 22].\nEnd-to-end memory networks are based on a recurrent attention mechanism instead of sequence-\naligned recurrence and have been shown to perform well on simple-language question answering and\nlanguage modeling tasks [34].\nTo the best of our knowledge, however, the Transformer is the first transduction model relying\nentirely on self-attention to compute representations of its input and output without using sequence-\naligned RNNs or convolution. In the following sections, we will describe the Transformer, motivate\nself-attention and discuss its advantages over models such as [17, 18] and [9].\n3 Model Architecture\nMost competitive neural sequence transduction models have an encoder-decoder structure [ 5,2,35].\nHere, the encoder maps an input sequence of symbol representations (x1, ..., x n)to a sequence\nof continuous representations z= (z1, ..., z n). Given z, the decoder then generates an output\nsequence (y1, ..., y m)of symbols one element at a time. At each step the model is auto-regressive\n[10], consuming the previously generated symbols as additional input when generating the next.\n2\nFigure 1: The Transformer - model architecture.\nThe Transformer follows this overall architecture using stacked self-attention and point-wise, fully\nconnected layers for both the encoder and decoder, shown in the left and right halves of Figure 1,\nrespectively.\n3.1 Encoder and Decoder Stacks\nEncoder: The encoder is composed of a stack of N= 6 identical layers. Each layer has two\nsub-layers. The first is a multi-head self-attention mechanism, and the second is a simple, position-\nwise fully connected feed-forward network. We employ a residual connection [ 11] around each of\nthe two sub-layers, followed by layer normalization [ 1]. That is, the output of each sub-layer is\nLayerNorm( x+ Sublayer( x)), where Sublayer( x)is the function implemented by the sub-layer\nitself. To facilitate these residual connections, all sub-layers in the model, as well as the embedding\nlayers, produce outputs of dimension dmodel = 512 .\nDecoder: The decoder is also composed of a stack of N= 6identical layers. In addition to the two\nsub-layers in each encoder layer, the decoder inserts a third sub-layer, which performs multi-head\nattention over the output of the encoder stack. Similar to the encoder, we employ residual connections\naround each of the sub-layers, followed by layer normalization. We also modify the self-attention\nsub-layer in the decoder stack to prevent positions from attending to subsequent positions. This\nmasking, combined with fact that the output embeddings are offset by one position, ensures that the\npredictions for position ican depend only on the known outputs at positions less than i.\n3.2 Attention\nAn attention function can be described as mapping a query and a set of key-value pairs to an output,\nwhere the query, keys, values, and output are all vectors. The output is computed as a weighted sum\n3\nScaled Dot-Product Attention\nMulti-Head Attention\nFigure 2: (left) Scaled Dot-Product Attention. (right) Multi-Head Attention consists of several\nattention layers running in parallel.\nof the values, where the weight assigned to each value is computed by a compatibility function of the\nquery with the corresponding key.\n3.2.1 Scaled Dot-Product Attention\nWe call our particular attention \"Scaled Dot-Product Attention\" (Figure 2). The input consists of\nqueries and keys of dimension dk, and values of dimension dv. We compute the dot products of the\nquery with all keys, divide each by√dk, and apply a softmax function to obtain the weights on the\nvalues.\nIn practice, we compute the attention function on a set of queries simultaneously, packed together\ninto a matrix Q. The keys and values are also packed together into matrices KandV. We compute\nthe matrix of outputs as:\nAttention( Q, K, V ) = softmax(QKT\n√dk)V (1)\nThe two most commonly used attention functions are additive attention [ 2], and dot-product (multi-\nplicative) attention. Dot-product attention is identical to our algorithm, except for the scaling factor\nof1√dk. Additive attention computes the compatibility function using a feed-forward network with\na single hidden layer. While the two are similar in theoretical complexity, dot-product attention is\nmuch faster and more space-efficient in practice, since it can be implemented using highly optimized\nmatrix multiplication code.\nWhile for small values of dkthe two mechanisms perform similarly, additive attention outperforms\ndot product attention without scaling for larger values of dk[3]. We suspect that for large values of\ndk, the dot products grow large in magnitude, pushing the softmax function into regions where it has\nextremely small gradients4. To counteract this effect, we scale the dot products by1√dk.\n3.2.2 Multi-Head Attention\nInstead of performing a single attention function with dmodel-dimensional keys, values and queries,\nwe found it beneficial to linearly project the queries, keys and values htimes with different, learned\nlinear projections to dk,dkanddvdimensions, respectively. On each of these projected versions of\nqueries, keys and values we then perform the attention function in parallel, yielding dv-dimensional\n4To illustrate why the dot products get large, assume that the components of qandkare independent random\nvariables with mean 0and variance 1. Then their dot product, q·k=Pdk\ni=1qiki, has mean 0and variance dk.\n4\noutput values. ",

For each of these we use\ndk=dv=dmodel/h= 64 . Due to the reduced dimension of each head, the total computational cost\nis similar to that of single-head attention with full dimensionality.\n3.2.3 Applications of Attention in our Model\nThe Transformer uses multi-head attention in three different ways:\n•In \"encoder-decoder attention\" layers, the queries come from the previous decoder layer,\nand the memory keys and values come from the output of the encoder. This allows every\nposition in the decoder to attend over all positions in the input sequence. This mimics the\ntypical encoder-decoder attention mechanisms in sequence-to-sequence models such as\n[38, 2, 9].\n•The encoder contains self-attention layers. In a self-attention layer all of the keys, values\nand queries come from the same place, in this case, the output of the previous layer in the\nencoder. Each position in the encoder can attend to all positions in the previous layer of the\nencoder.\n•Similarly, self-attention layers in the decoder allow each position in the decoder to attend to\nall positions in the decoder up to and including that position. We need to prevent leftward\ninformation flow in the decoder to preserve the auto-regressive property. We implement this\ninside of scaled dot-product attention by masking out (setting to −∞) all values in the input\nof the softmax which correspond to illegal connections. See Figure 2.\n3.3 Position-wise Feed-Forward Networks\nIn addition to attention sub-layers, each of the layers in our encoder and decoder contains a fully\nconnected feed-forward network, which is applied to each position separately and identically. This\nconsists of two linear transformations with a ReLU activation in between.\nFFN( x) = max(0 , xW 1+b1)W2+b2 (2)\nWhile the linear transformations are the same across different positions, they use different parameters\nfrom layer to layer. Another way of describing this is as two convolutions with kernel size 1.\n",

In the embedding layers, we multiply those weights by√dmodel.\n5\nTable 1: Maximum path lengths, per-layer complexity and minimum number of sequential operations\nfor different layer types. nis the sequence length, dis the representation dimension, kis the kernel\nsize of convolutions and rthe size of the neighborhood in restricted self-attention.\nLayer Type Complexity per Layer Sequential Maximum Path Length\nOperations\nSelf-Attention O(n2·d) O(1) O(1)\nRecurrent O(n·d2) O(n) O(n)\nConvolutional O(k·n·d2) O(1) O(logk(n))\nSelf-Attention (restricted) O(r·n·d) O(1) O(n/r)\n3.5 Positional Encoding\nSince our model contains no recurrence and no convolution, in order for the model to make use of the\norder of the sequence, we must inject some information about the relative or absolute position of the\ntokens in the sequence. To this end, we add \"positional encodings\" to the input embeddings at the\nbottoms of the encoder and decoder stacks. The positional encodings have the same dimension dmodel\nas the embeddings, so that the two can be summed. There are many choices of positional encodings,\nlearned and fixed [9].\nIn this work, we use sine and cosine functions of different frequencies:\nPE(pos,2i)=sin(pos/100002i/d model)\nPE(pos,2i+1)=cos(pos/100002i/d model)\nwhere posis the position and iis the dimension. That is, each dimension of the positional encoding\ncorresponds to a sinusoid. The wavelengths form a geometric progression from 2πto10000 ·2π. We\nchose this function because we hypothesized it would allow the model to easily learn to attend by\nrelative positions, since for any fixed offset k,PEpos+kcan be represented as a linear function of\nPEpos.\nWe also experimented with using learned positional embeddings [ 9] instead, and found that the two\nversions produced nearly identical results (see Table 3 row (E)). We chose the sinusoidal version\nbecause it may allow the model to extrapolate to sequence lengths longer than the ones encountered\nduring training.\n4 Why Self-Attention\nIn this section we compare various aspects of self-attention layers to the recurrent and convolu-\ntional layers commonly used for mapping one variable-length sequence of symbol representations\n(x1, ..., x n)to another sequence of equal length (z1, ..., z n), with xi, zi∈Rd, such as a hidden\nlayer in a typical sequence transduction encoder or decoder. Motivating our use of self-attention we\nconsider three desiderata.\nOne is the total computational complexity per layer. Another is the amount of computation that can\nbe parallelized, as measured by the minimum number of sequential operations required.\nThe third is the path length between long-range dependencies in the network. Learning long-range\ndependencies is a key challenge in many sequence transduction tasks. One key factor affecting the\nability to learn such dependencies is the length of the paths forward and backward signals have to\ntraverse in the network. The shorter these paths between any combination of positions in the input\nand output sequences, the easier it is to learn long-range dependencies [ 12]. Hence we also compare\nthe maximum path length between any two input and output positions in networks composed of the\ndifferent layer types.\nAs noted in Table 1, a self-attention layer connects all positions with a constant number of sequentially\nexecuted operations, whereas a recurrent layer requires O(n)sequential operations. In terms of\ncomputational complexity, self-attention layers are faster than recurrent layers when the sequence\n6\nlength nis smaller than the representation dimensionality d, which is most often the case with\nsentence representations used by state-of-the-art models in machine translations, such as word-piece\n[38] and byte-pair [ 31] representations. To improve computational performance for tasks involving\nvery long sequences, self-attention could be restricted to considering only a neighborhood of size rin\nthe input sequence centered around the respective output position. This would increase the maximum\npath length to O(n/r). We plan to investigate this approach further in future work.\nA single convolutional layer with kernel width k < n does not connect all pairs of input and output\npositions. Doing so requires a stack of O(n/k)convolutional layers in the case of contiguous kernels,\norO(logk(n))in the case of dilated convolutions [ 18], increasing the length of the longest paths\nbetween any two positions in the network. Convolutional layers are generally more expensive than\nrecurrent layers, by a factor of k. Separable convolutions [ 6], however, decrease the complexity\nconsiderably, to O(k·n·d+n·d2). Even with k=n, however, the complexity of a separable\nconvolution is equal to the combination of a self-attention layer and a point-wise feed-forward layer,\nthe approach we take in our model.\nAs side benefit, self-attention could yield more interpretable models.

Not only do individual attention\nheads clearly learn to perform different tasks, many appear to exhibit behavior related to the syntactic\nand semantic structure of the sentences.\n5 Training\nThis section describes the training regime for our models.\n5.1 Training Data and Batching\nWe trained on the standard WMT 2014 English-German dataset consisting of about 4.5 million\nsentence pairs. Sentences were encoded using byte-pair encoding [ 3], which has a shared source-\ntarget vocabulary of about 37000 tokens. For English-French, we used the significantly larger WMT\n2014 English-French dataset consisting of 36M sentences and split tokens into a 32000 word-piece\nvocabulary [ 38]. Sentence pairs were batched together by approximate sequence length. Each training\nbatch contained a set of sentence pairs containing approximately 25000 source tokens and 25000\ntarget tokens.\n5.2 Hardware and Schedule\nWe trained our models on one machine with 8 NVIDIA P100 GPUs. For our base models using\nthe hyperparameters described throughout the paper, each training step took about 0.4 seconds. We\ntrained the base models for a total of 100,000 steps or 12 hours. For our big models,(described on the\nbottom line of table 3), step time was 1.0 seconds. The big models were trained for 300,000 steps\n(3.5 days).\n5.3 Optimizer\nWe used the Adam optimizer [ 20] with β1= 0.9,β2= 0.98andϵ= 10−9. We varied the learning\nrate over the course of training, according to the formula:\nlrate =d−0.5\nmodel·min(step_num−0.5, step _num·warmup _steps−1.5) (3)\nThis corresponds to increasing the learning rate linearly for the first warmup _steps training steps,\nand decreasing it thereafter proportionally to the inverse square root of the step number. We used\nwarmup _steps = 4000 .\n5.4 Regularization\nWe employ three types of regularization during training:\n7\nTable 2: The Transformer achieves better BLEU scores than previous state-of-the-art models on the\nEnglish-to-German and English-to-French newstest2014 tests at a fraction of the training cost.\nModelBLEU Training Cost (FLOPs)\nEN-DE EN-FR EN-DE EN-FR\nByteNet [18] 23.75\nDeep-Att + PosUnk [39] 39.2 1.0·1020\nGNMT + RL [38] 24.6 39.92 2.3·10191.4·1020\nConvS2S [9] 25.16 40.46 9.6·10181.5·1020\nMoE [32] 26.03 40.56 2.0·10191.2·1020\nDeep-Att + PosUnk Ensemble [39] 40.4 8.0·1020\nGNMT + RL Ensemble [38] 26.30 41.16 1.8·10201.1·1021\nConvS2S Ensemble [9] 26.36 41.29 7.7·10191.2·1021\nTransformer (base model) 27.3 38.1 3.3·1018\nTransformer (big) 28.4 41.8 2.3·1019\nResidual Dropout We apply dropout [ 33] to the output of each sub-layer, before it is added to the\nsub-layer input and normalized.

On both WMT 2014 English-to-German and WMT 2014\nEnglish-to-French translation tasks, we achieve a new state of the art. In the former task our best\nmodel outperforms even all previously reported ensembles.\nWe are excited about the future of attention-based models and plan to apply them to other tasks. We\nplan to extend the Transformer to problems involving input and output modalities other than text and\nto investigate local, restricted attention mechanisms to efficiently handle large inputs and outputs\nsuch as images, audio and video.

          "answer": "Depthwise separable convolutions are a key concept introduced in Francois Chollet's work on the Xception model. This approach divides the conventional convolution operation into two separate layers that effectively reduce computation complexity and improve efficiency while maintaining good performance for tasks such as image classification.\n\nThe first component of a depthwise separable convolution is the **depthwise convolution**. In this part, a single convolutional filter is applied to each input channel independently. This means that instead of combining information across multiple channels in a single filter, each original channel (e.g., red, green, and blue in an RGB image) is processed distinctly. This structure allows the model to learn channel-wise features without the redundancy of handling channel intersections simultaneously.\n\nFollowing the depthwise step, the second component is the **pointwise convolution**. This is essentially a standard convolution with a kernel size of 1x1, applied to the output of the depthwise layer. The purpose of pointwise convolution is to mix the outputs from the depthwise layer across the different channels, enabling the model to learn integrated features that combine these separate channel representations.\n\nThe significance of depthwise separable convolutions lies in their efficiency; they drastically cut down the number of parameters and computations involved in a model. For instance, while a traditional convolution applies a kernel across both the spatial dimensions and the depth of the input, depthwise separable convolutions separate these concerns, resulting in a less computationally expensive process. This innovation leads to improved performance in deep learning tasks while requiring fewer resources, which is especially valuable when working with large datasets or deploying on devices with limited processing power.\n\nIn summary, depthwise separable convolutions consist of a two-step process involving independent processing of input channels followed by mixing these processed channels, ultimately enhancing computational efficiency and effectiveness in neural networks.",

          "question": "How do depthwise separable convolutions differ from traditional convolutions?",
          "answer": "Depthwise separable convolutions differ from traditional convolutions primarily in their operational structure and efficiency. In traditional convolutions, a single convolutional layer applies a number of filters to the entire input, resulting in a new set of feature maps. Each filter performs a 3D convolution, considering all input channels simultaneously. This means that the number of computations is determined by the number of input channels, the size of the filter, and the number of output channels, leading to a high computational cost, especially with deep networks.\n\nIn contrast, depthwise separable convolutions break this process into two distinct layers: a depthwise convolution followed by a pointwise convolution. The depthwise convolution applies a single filter to each input channel independently, which drastically reduces the number of parameters and computations, as it does not combine information across channels at this stage. Subsequently, the pointwise convolution (a 1x1 convolution) is used to mix the outputs of the depthwise layer, allowing for feature combination while keeping the computations lower than in traditional convolutions. \n\nOverall, depthwise separable convolutions are more efficient, as they require fewer computations and parameters compared to traditional convolutional layers, making them particularly advantageous in resource-constrained environments or for accelerating model training and inference without significantly compromising performance. This approach is highlighted in the architecture of models like Xception, which utilize depthwise separable convolutions to enhance efficiency while maintaining robust learning capabilities.",

This reduction allows for a significant decrease in the number of parameters and computations, making the model lighter and faster to train.\n\n2. **Lower Memory Usage**: Because depthwise separable convolutions require fewer parameters than standard convolutions, they also consume less memory. This characteristic is particularly beneficial when working with resource-constrained environments or deploying models on mobile and embedded devices.\n\n3. **Enhanced Feature Extraction**: The two-step process allows the model to learn spatial features independently via depthwise convolution, while the pointwise convolution then combines these features. This separation can enhance the model's ability to capture complex patterns and relationships in the data.\n\n4. **Improved Performance**: Empirical evidence suggests that models using depthwise separable convolutions, such as the Xception architecture, often achieve better performance on various benchmarks compared to traditional convolutional architectures. This is likely due to the enhanced expressiveness facilitated by the decoupling of spatial and channel-wise operations.\n\nIn summary, the use of depthwise separable convolutions in deep learning presents advantages in computational and memory efficiency while improving performance, making them a favored choice in modern neural network architectures.",

The relationship between depthwise separable convolutions and model efficiency can be understood through several dimensions: computational resource reduction, parameter efficiency, and performance outcomes.\n\n1. **Computational Resource Reduction**: Depthwise separable convolutions decompose a standard convolution into two distinct operations: a depthwise convolution and a pointwise convolution. The depthwise convolution applies a single filter to each input channel separately, while the pointwise convolution is a 1x1 convolution that combines the outputs of the depthwise layer. This significantly decreases the number of computations required for each convolution, leading to faster processing times and the ability to run models on hardware with limited computational power.\n\n2. **Parameter Efficiency**: By separating the convolutions, this approach reduces the number of parameters needed in a model. Traditional convolutions compute outputs across multiple channels simultaneously, which can quickly lead to large numbers of parameters and increased memory usage. In contrast, depthwise separable convolutions streamline the process, allowing for models that retain competitive accuracy with far fewer parameters. This makes the architecture less memory-intensive and easier to deploy, especially in environments where resources are constrained.\n\n3. **Performance Outcomes**: Despite their reduced complexity, depthwise separable convolutions have been shown to maintain or even improve performance on various tasks. This is especially relevant in image classification and other vision-related tasks, where the balance of efficiency and accuracy is critical. The efficiency gains from this approach do not come at the expense of the model's capability to learn complex patterns from data. Rather, the structure of depthwise separable convolutions can facilitate better generalization through their unique design.\n\nIn summary, depthwise separable convolutions enhance model efficiency by reducing both computational and memory requirements while providing a framework that can still achieve high performance levels, demonstrating a crucial advancement in the design of neural networks within the deep learning field.",

For TensorFlow/Keras, you can use `tf.keras.layers.SeparableConv2D`, which encapsulates both the depthwise and pointwise operations in one layer.\n\n3. **Layer Configuration**:\n   - **Define Input Shape**: Start by defining the input shape that matches your data dimensions, typically in the format (height, width, channels).\n   - **Create Depthwise Separable Layers**: Implement the layers in sequence. You might structure your model as follows:\n     ```python\n     model = tf.keras.Sequential()\n     model.add(tf.keras.layers.Input(shape=(height, width, channels)))\n     model.add(tf.keras.layers.SeparableConv2D(filters=32, kernel_size=3, activation='relu'))\n     model.add(tf.keras.layers.BatchNormalization())\n     model.add(tf.keras.layers.MaxPooling2D(pool_size=(2, 2)))\n     ```\n   - Modify the number of filters and kernel sizes as needed based on your specific project goals.\n\n4. **Pooling Layers**: Incorporate max pooling or average pooling after the depthwise separable layers to reduce dimensionality while maintaining spatial hierarchy.\n\n5. **Compile the Model**: After defining your architecture, compile the model using an appropriate optimizer (e.g., Adam), loss function (e.g., categorical crossentropy for multi-class classification), and metrics (e.g., accuracy):\n    ```python\n    model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='categorical_crossentropy', metrics=['accuracy'])\n    ```\n\n6. **Training**: Fit your model using your training dataset, ensuring to monitor validation metrics to avoid overfitting. Utilize callbacks, such as Early Stopping, to stop training when performance starts to decline.\n\n7. **Evaluation and Tuning**: After training the model, evaluate its performance on a testing dataset. Based on the results, you may need to adjust hyperparameters, such as the number of filters, kernel sizes, or learning rates.\n\nBy employing depthwise separable convolutions, you can build a less resource-intensive model while potentially retaining or enhancing performance, as observed in the Xception architecture outlined in Chollet's work.",

A depthwise convolution applies a single filter to each input channel, while pointwise convolution (1x1 convolution) combines the outputs from the depthwise step.\n\n2. **Replacing Standard Convolutions**: In your modified model, identify where standard convolutional layers occur and replace them with depthwise separable convolutions. For example, if the model originally has a convolution layer defined as `Conv2D(filters=k, kernel_size=(f, f))`, you would replace it with:\n   - A depthwise convolution layer: `DepthwiseConv2D(kernel_size=(f, f))`\n   - Followed by a pointwise convolution layer: `Conv2D(filters=k, kernel_size=(1, 1))`\n\n3. **Adjusting the Filter Sizes**: The key advantage of using depthwise separable convolutions is the reduction in model complexity and parameters. Since depthwise convolutions apply filters to each channel separately and then combine them through pointwise convolutions, this should allow the model to maintain a similar or even improved performance while being computationally cheaper. Ensure that the filter sizes and the number of filters in the pointwise convolution correctly match the output of the depthwise layer.\n\n4. **Normalize and Optimize**: After modifying the layers, consider implementing normalization techniques (like Batch Normalization) to improve the training dynamics further and possibly utilize dropout layers for regularization if necessary.\n\n5. **Training and Fine-tuning**: Finally, train the modified model carefully, adjusting hyperparameters as needed.

Mathematically, for an input tensor with \\( C_{in} \\) channels and filters of size \\( K \\times K \\), the computational cost can be approximated as:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Cost}_{standard} = C_{out} \\times K \\times K \\times C_{in} \\times H \\times W\n\\]\n\nwhere \\( C_{out} \\) is the number of output channels, \\( H \\) and \\( W \\) are the height and width of the input feature maps.\n\n**Depthwise Separable Convolutions** divide the convolution operation into two steps: a depthwise convolution followed by a pointwise convolution. The depthwise convolution applies a single filter per input channel, and the pointwise convolution combines these features across channels. Therefore, the computational cost can be expressed as:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Cost}_{depthwise} = C_{in} \\times K \\times K \\times H \\times W + C_{out} \\times C_{in} \\times H \\times W\n\\]\n\nHere, the first term accounts for the cost of the depthwise convolution while the second term accounts for the pointwise convolution.\n\n**Comparison of Costs**:\n1. **Efficiency in Computation**: Depthwise separable convolutions are significantly more computationally efficient than standard convolutions. The first term in the depthwise separable convolution cost involves only \\( C_{in} \\) channels, while standard convolutions require a complete \\( C_{in} \\times C_{out} \\) processing.

          "question": "Break down the advantages and potential drawbacks of using depthwise separable convolutions.",
          "answer": "Depthwise separable convolutions, as introduced in the Xception model by Francois Chollet, present a number of advantages and potential drawbacks. Let's analyze them in detail:\n\n### Advantages:\n\n1. **Reduced Parameter Count**: Depthwise separable convolutions split the standard convolution operation into two distinct layers: a depthwise convolution and a pointwise convolution. This separation drastically reduces the number of parameters in the model compared to traditional convolutions. As a result, models can be trained more quickly and require less memory, which is especially beneficial for mobile and embedded applications.\n\n2. **Faster Computation**: Due to the reduced number of parameters, depthwise separable convolutions offer faster computation times. This is crucial in real-time systems where inference speed is a priority.\n\n3. **Improved Feature Learning**: The depthwise convolution applies a single filter per input channel, which can lead to a more nuanced understanding of features from the input data. The subsequent pointwise convolution allows for combining the outputs of the depthwise layer, enhancing the model's capability to learn complex feature representations.\n\n4. **Efficiency**: The reduced complexity enhances overall efficiency, making the model less susceptible to overfitting on smaller datasets. This efficiency is particularly advantageous for mobile and edge devices with limited computational resources.\n\n### Potential Drawbacks:\n\n1. **Loss of Information**: By applying a single filter to each input channel separately, depthwise separable convolutions may miss out on interactions between channels that traditional convolutions naturally capture. This might lead to a potential loss of information, particularly in datasets where inter-channel relationships are crucial.\n\n2. **Design Complexity**: While this approach can simplify network architectures, it may also introduce complexities in model design, especially when determining the appropriate number of filters and layers. Developers may require additional experimentation to find the optimal configuration.\n\n3. **Performance Trade-offs**: In certain cases, models using depthwise separable convolutions may not perform as well as their traditional counterparts on complex tasks requiring extensive feature interaction. This could lead to suboptimal results in applications where high accuracy is crucial.\n\n4. **Limited Applicability**: Depthwise separable convolutions may not be suitable for all types of neural networks or datasets, particularly in networks that rely heavily on high-dimensional feature interactions. This limited applicability could restrict their use to certain domains or tasks.\n\nIn summary, while depthwise separable convolutions present significant advantages in terms of efficiency and reduced computational cost, careful consideration must be given to their limitations regarding information capture and the complexity of design in certain contexts.",

Unlike traditional convolutions that apply filters across the entire depth of input channels, depthwise separable convolutions split this process into two distinct operations: a depthwise convolution followed by a pointwise convolution. This separation allows for more efficient computation and parameter reduction, drastically lowering the number of operations required.\n\n2. **Increased Efficiency**: By adopting depthwise separable convolutions, Xception is able to achieve a smaller model size while maintaining or even enhancing accuracy. This efficiency is crucial, especially for deployment in resource-limited environments such as mobile devices. The reduction in parameters means faster training and inference times without sacrificing performance.\n\n3. **Scalability of Model Capacity**: Xception improves upon earlier architectures by increasing the depth of the network while maintaining a manageable number of parameters. This scalability allows for better feature extraction and representation learning, leading to improved performance on tasks involving complex data.\n\n4. **Architectural Design**: The Xception model builds on the Inception architecture, where the design and organization of the network layers facilitate connections that enhance feature learning.

          "answer": "Depthwise separable convolutions differ from standard convolutions in that they separate the process of filtering and combining features, which significantly reduces computational complexity and improves model efficiency.\n\nIn standard convolutions, each convolutional layer applies a set of filters to the entire input feature map. Each filter combines information across all input channels and produces a single output channel for each filter, resulting in a large number of computations, especially as the number of input and output channels increases.\n\nConversely, depthwise separable convolutions break this process into two distinct layers: a depthwise convolution followed by a pointwise convolution. \n\n1. **Depthwise Convolution**: In this step, a single convolutional filter is applied to each input channel independently. This means that if there are \\( M \\) input channels, \\( M \\) separate filters are used, one for each channel, thereby maintaining the spatial structure while reducing the number of parameters and computations.\n\n2. **Pointwise Convolution**: Following the depthwise convolution, a 1x1 convolution (pointwise convolution) is used to combine the outputs from the depthwise layer across channels. This step allows for the merging of information across different channels, which is critical for learning more complex features.\n\nBy this separation, depthwise separable convolutions achieve a reduction in computational cost compared to standard convolutions. This efficiency is particularly beneficial for deep neural networks, allowing for faster training and inference while maintaining or improving performance on tasks like image classification and object detection.\n\nIn summary, the key differences lie in the structure and computation involved: standard convolutions operate jointly across all channels, whereas depthwise separable convolutions break this process into two steps that analyze channels independently and then merge the results, leading to reduced complexity and increased efficiency.",

This approach enhances deep learning by improving efficiency and performance in convolutional neural networks (CNNs). \n\nIn Xception, the architecture is structured around a series of depthwise separable convolution layers. Each of these layers consists of two main operations: a depthwise convolution followed by a pointwise convolution. The depthwise convolution applies a single filter for each input channel, allowing for spatial feature extraction independently across channels. This is then followed by pointwise convolution that combines these features across all channels with a 1x1 convolution. This separation of the convolution process significantly reduces the number of parameters and computational cost compared to traditional convolution operations, which use a single filter across all channels simultaneously.\n\nAdditionally, Xception is built around a modified Inception module, where the depthwise separable convolutions replace the standard convolutions used in the original Inception architecture. This structural design leads to improvements in model efficiency, as it reduces the complexity of the network while maintaining or even improving accuracy in various deep learning tasks such as image classification.\n\nBy utilizing depthwise separable convolutions, Xception not only lowers the computational burden on systems with limited resources but also enhances the ability of deep learning models to generalize and perform on complex datasets.

The architecture allows Xception to capture relationships across spatial dimensions while simultaneously integrating channel information, which enhances feature extraction capabilities and accuracy, especially in computer vision tasks.\n\n4. **Pre-trained Models and Transfer Learning**: The training process often involves using pre-trained weights from large datasets (e.g., ImageNet). The ability to leverage transfer learning allows the model to start with a strong feature representation, leading to faster convergence and better performance on specific tasks. Fine-tuning these pre-trained models on target datasets further improves results, making the training process more efficient.\n\n5. **Regularization Techniques**: To enhance generalization, the training process includes techniques like dropout and batch normalization. Dropout prevents overfitting by randomly deactivating a subset of neurons during training, while batch normalization stabilizes learning by normalizing the inputs to each layer, improving convergence speed.\n\n6. **Optimization Algorithms**: Xception commonly employs advanced optimization techniques such as Adam or RMSprop, which adapt learning rates per parameter and help navigate the complex loss landscapes effectively.\n\n7. **Augmentation and Preprocessing**: During the training phase, data augmentation techniques are frequently used to artificially expand the training dataset, which introduces variability and improves the model's robustness. Standard preprocessing steps like normalization and resizing also contribute to the training efficacy.\n\nIn summary, the training process of the Xception model hinges on its innovative use of depthwise separable convolutions, leading to an efficient architecture that captures complex patterns while minimizing computational costs.

          "answer": "Depthwise separable convolutions offer a distinct approach to processing data compared to traditional convolutions, primarily in terms of how they compute and structure their operations.\n\nIn traditional convolutions, a single convolutional layer applies filters to the input feature maps, combining spatial and channel information in one step. This necessitates a large number of parameters as each filter is typically applied across all input channels. For instance, if you have an input with multiple channels (like RGB images), the convolution operation applies a kernel to all channels simultaneously, producing an output channel that is a blend of the inputs.\n\nIn contrast, depthwise separable convolutions break this process into two separate operations: the depthwise convolution and the pointwise convolution. \n\n1. **Depthwise Convolution**: This first step applies a single filter per input channel (depth), which processes each channel independently. Thus, if there are ‘C’ channels in the input, ‘C’ separate filters are applied, leading to a similar number of output channels as the depth of the input.\n\n2. **Pointwise Convolution**: The subsequent step involves a standard 1x1 convolution across the different channels resulting from the depthwise convolution. This layer effectively mixes the outputs of the depthwise layer to create new features. \n\nThe key advantage of depthwise separable convolutions lies in their efficiency; they drastically reduce the number of parameters and computational cost while retaining model performance. By separating the spatial filtering (depthwise convolution) from the linear combination of the outputs (pointwise convolution), deeper models can be built with fewer resources, making them particularly suitable for mobile and embedded applications where computational resources may be limited.\n\nIn summary, depthwise separable convolutions differ from traditional convolutions by decoupling the filtering process into two distinct steps—allowing for reduced parameter counts and increased computational efficiency, which may lead to faster model training and inference without significant loss in performance.",

          "answer": "Depthwise separable convolutions offer several advantages over regular convolutions that enhance both the efficiency and performance of deep learning models. Here are the key advantages explained:\n\n1. **Reduced Computational Cost**: Depthwise separable convolutions break the convolution operation into two simpler operations: a depthwise convolution, which applies a single filter to each input channel, and a pointwise convolution, which combines the outputs across channels. This separation significantly reduces the number of parameters and computations required compared to a standard convolution that operates across all channels simultaneously.\n\n2. **Fewer Parameters**: Because depthwise convolutions apply a single filter per input channel and the pointwise convolution combines those outputs using 1x1 kernels, the overall number of parameters in the network is drastically lower. This reduction not only lessens the amount of memory needed for storing the model but also speeds up the training and inference times.\n\n3. **Improved Model Performance**: The reduction in parameters and complexity inherent to depthwise separable convolutions allows models to be more efficient without sacrificing performance. In many cases, models utilizing this type of convolution can achieve similar or even superior accuracy compared to conventional convolutional neural networks (CNNs), particularly in tasks that require extracting multi-scale features.\n\n4. **Better Generalization**: With fewer parameters, models are less prone to overfitting, thus improving their ability to generalize to unseen data. This characteristic is particularly advantageous in scenarios where the training dataset is limited.\n\nOverall, depthwise separable convolutions are a powerful alternative to regular convolutions, facilitating the creation of more efficient and effective deep learning architectures.",

It is designed to enhance the efficiency and performance of neural networks, especially in deep learning architectures.\n\n### Process of Depthwise Separable Convolution:\n\n1. **Standard Convolution vs. Depthwise Separable Convolution**:\n   - Traditional convolution involves a convolution operation where a single filter operates across the entire input, integrating contributions from all input channels. This results in a computational overhead, especially in networks with many channels.\n   - Depthwise separable convolution breaks this operation into two distinct layers: a depthwise convolution followed by a pointwise convolution.\n\n2. **Step 1: Depthwise Convolution**:\n   - In the first step, depthwise convolution applies a single filter per input channel. For an input with multiple channels (e.g., RGB image with 3 channels), each input channel is convolved independently with its own filter.\n   - If there are 'C' input channels and the filter size is 'K x K', the computation requires 'C * K^2' multiplications for each output pixel.\n   - The output from this step still retains the input’s depth (number of channels), but each channel is processed separately, leading to a reduction in computational complexity.\n\n3. **Step 2: Pointwise Convolution**:\n   - The second step is a pointwise convolution, which uses a '1x1' convolution. This layer combines the outputs from the depthwise convolution by linearly mixing them across the depth.\n   - For instance, if the depthwise convolution produced an output with 'D' channels, the pointwise convolution can be applied with 'N' filters, generating a new output of 'N' channels. This can be thought of as creating a weighted sum of the depthwise outputs for each filter.\n   - The pointwise convolution requires 'D * N' multiplications for each output pixel, further enhancing efficiency.\n\n### Overall Benefit:\nThe overall benefit of depthwise separable convolution is twofold:\n- It significantly reduces the number of parameters and computational cost compared to traditional convolutions, making it more suitable for mobile and edge devices.\n- It preserves performance by allowing deeper architectures and more complex representations while leading to a reduction in overfitting due to fewer parameters.\n\nIn conclusion, depthwise separable convolutions enhance model efficiency and effectiveness by decoupling the channel processing into depthwise and pointwise operations, streamlining the computation process in deep learning networks.",

This model can be viewed as an extension of the Inception module but with significant enhancements that lead to improvements in efficiency and performance.\n\nThe architecture of Xception consists of a series of depthwise separable convolution layers. The concept of depthwise separable convolutions divides the convolution operation into two distinct operations: depthwise convolution and pointwise convolution. \n\n1. **Depthwise Convolution**: This operation applies a single filter for each input channel (or depth), maintaining the spatial dimensions but reducing the number of parameters and computational cost significantly.

The depthwise convolution applies a single filter per input channel, which means that it operates on each channel independently. Subsequently, the pointwise convolution applies a standard convolution operation that combines the outputs from the depthwise convolution into a new representation.\n\nHere's how to integrate depthwise separable convolutions into a different neural network and assess its performance:\n\n1. **Reduced Complexity and Computational Load**: Depthwise separable convolutions significantly reduce the number of parameters and computations compared to traditional convolutions (which perform operations across all input channels at once). For a neural network that has large layers with numerous filters, incorporating depthwise separable convolutions can result in a model that is lighter and faster. This is particularly beneficial when deploying models on edge devices where resource constraints are a concern.\n\n2. **Share Parameters Across Channels**: In a conventional convolutional layer, each filter learns a unique set of parameters for each input channel. Depthwise separable convolutions utilize fewer parameters by sharing them across channels in the depthwise phase and later integrating them in the pointwise phase. For networks that require efficiency but also good performance, this mechanism allows for faster training times and reduced memory usage.\n\n3. **Performance Estimation**: By replacing traditional convolutional layers with depthwise separable convolutions in architectures like MobileNet or others, we can estimate performance improvements by:\n   - Performing ablation studies to observe how model accuracy varies with the inclusion of depthwise separable convolutions.\n   - Monitoring the inference speed and memory footprint on specific tasks after integration into the neural network. Given that depthwise separable convolutions can capture feature representations effectively with fewer parameters, we can expect a balanced trade-off between accuracy and resource utilization.\n\n4. **Flexibility**: Because depthwise separable convolutions maintain the ability to learn complex representations, they offer high flexibility. In different neural network architectures, like in the task of image classification, we could interchange these convolutions and evaluate maintained or improved levels of accuracy without an increase in computational demand.\n\n5. **Experimentation**: Lastly, applying depthwise separable convolutions means that extensive experimentation is essential to assess how this approach affects the performance metric of interest (like accuracy, precision, recall, etc.) in the context of the specific dataset and application domain in the new network architecture.\n\nIn summary, by integrating depthwise separable convolutions into different neural network architectures, we can potentially achieve a more efficient and faster model while maintaining or improving performance, making it particularly suited for applications in mobile and embedded systems.",

To suit a smaller dataset, consider reducing the number of depthwise separable convolution layers. This could involve decreasing the number of filters in each layer or removing some layers altogether. Simplifying the architecture will help in avoiding overfitting, which is a common issue when training on limited data.\n\n2. **Use Transfer Learning**: Instead of training the Xception model from scratch, leverage a pre-trained version of Xception on a larger dataset (such as ImageNet). Fine-tuning the model on your smaller dataset can lead to better performance, as the model retains useful features learned during the initial training.\n\n3. **Regularization Techniques**: Incorporate regularization methods, such as dropout or L2 regularization, to mitigate overfitting. Since smaller datasets are more prone to overfitting, employing these techniques can help maintain the model's generalization capability.\n\n4. **Data Augmentation**: Implement data augmentation techniques to artificially expand the training dataset. This can include rotations, flips, zooms, shifts, and color changes to create variations of the existing dataset, making it more robust and aiding in better training of the model.\n\n5. **Reduce Input Size**: Scaling down the input size can also be beneficial. The Xception network typically expects a specific input resolution; by reducing this resolution, the model's complexity can be decreased, and it could still perform well on the smaller dataset.\n\n6. **Adjust Training Parameters**: Modify hyperparameters such as learning rate, batch size, and the number of epochs. Due to the smaller dataset, you might need to carefully choose a lower learning rate and potentially reduce the batch size to ensure that the model learns effectively without overfitting.\n\nBy combining these strategies, one can effectively adapt the Xception architecture for training on a smaller dataset while maintaining a balance between model performance and complexity.",

This architectural approach allows for better feature extraction while significantly reducing the number of parameters and computations compared to traditional convolutions.\n  \n- **VGG**: The VGG architecture is characterized by its use of small (3x3) convolution filters stacked on top of each other, allowing the model to learn complex features at multiple depths. It focuses on simplicity with a deep structure that has a consistent architecture, but it has a high number of parameters leading to increased computational costs.\n\n- **ResNet**: The main innovation of ResNet is the introduction of residual connections (or skip connections), which allow gradients to flow through the network more effectively, alleviating the vanishing gradient problem often seen in deeper networks. This architectural design enables the construction of much deeper networks while maintaining performance.\n\n### Computational Efficiency\n- **Xception**: The use of separable convolutions in Xception results in a more efficient model both in terms of parameter count and computational cost. It can achieve competitive performance with significantly fewer resources compared to traditional convolutional networks.\n\n- **VGG**: While VGG can achieve strong performance on tasks such as image classification, its deep architecture with numerous parameters means it is computationally heavy and slower to train and infer. This makes VGG less efficient compared to Xception.\n\n- **ResNet**: ResNet models are generally more efficient than VGG due to the effective use of skip connections, which allow for easier training of deeper networks without incurring additional computational burden. However, the parameter efficiency relative to the depth does not reach the advancements offered by Xception’s depthwise separable convolutions.\n\n### Performance\n- **Xception**: Xception has shown state-of-the-art performance on various benchmarks, leveraging the depthwise separable convolution approach to extract features effectively. It is known for maintaining high accuracy while being computationally efficient.\n\n- **VGG**: Although VGG demonstrated impressive results during its time and is foundational in image classification tasks, it often requires more resources and may not outperform modern architectures like Xception in both efficiency and accuracy.\n\n- **ResNet**: ResNet has set new standards in performance for deep networks, often outperforming both VGG and earlier architectures on complex datasets like ImageNet. Its design allows it to be not only effective in training but also capable of scaling to significant depths with improved accuracy.\n\n### Conclusion\nIn summary, Xception stands out due to the innovative use of depthwise separable convolutions which streamline the architecture making it both efficient and high-performing. VGG's simpler architecture and depth provide solid performance, but at a high computational cost. ResNet, while also performing well through deeper architectures with residual connections, does not match the parameter efficiency of Xception.

          "answer": "Depthwise separable convolutions, as introduced by Francois Chollet in the Xception architecture, have a significant impact on the training time of models. To analyze this effect, we can break it down into two key components: the reduction in the number of parameters and computational complexity.\n\n1. **Reduction in Parameters**: Traditional convolutions involve a single convolution operation per channel, combining all input channels into a single output. This leads to a large number of parameters, particularly when the input has a high dimensionality. In contrast, depthwise separable convolutions split this process into two stages: a depthwise convolution, which applies a single filter per input channel, followed by a pointwise convolution that linearly combines the outputs from the depthwise step. This division significantly reduces the number of parameters and, consequently, the memory usage during training.\n\n2. **Computational Efficiency**: By reducing the total number of operations needed to compute the convolutions, depthwise separable convolutions lead to lower computational costs. The depthwise convolution operates independently on each channel, resulting in a smaller number of multiplications compared to standard convolutions. The subsequent pointwise convolution, while still combining channels, requires fewer overall calculations due to the initial reduction in the number of outputs from the depthwise step. The result is faster computations, which can considerably shorten training times, especially on large datasets and complex models.\n\n3. **Impact on Training Time**: With fewer parameters to manage and less computational overhead, the training process becomes more efficient. Models can converge faster as they require fewer epochs to achieve optimal performance, which is beneficial for both training speed and resource usage. This efficiency is particularly pronounced in larger models, where traditional convolutions can slow down training significantly due to their higher parameter count and computational requirements.\n\nIn summary, depthwise separable convolutions substantially reduce the training time of models by lessening both the number of parameters and the computational load. This allows for quicker convergence, enabling deeper and more complex architectures to be trained more efficiently, thereby making them a favorable choice in modern deep learning applications.",

          "question": "Contrast the computational requirements of depthwise separable convolutions with traditional convolutions.",
          "answer": "Depthwise separable convolutions and traditional convolutions represent two different approaches in deep learning, particularly within the context of neural network architectures.\n\n1. **Computational Requirements**:\n   - **Traditional Convolutions**: In traditional convolutions, each filter is applied over all the input channels simultaneously. This means that if you have an input tensor with \\( C_{in} \\) channels and you use \\( K \\) filters each of size \\( H \\times W \\), the computational cost is proportional to \\( H \\times W \\times C_{in} \\times K \\). This results in a significant number of operations since every filter interacts with every channel, making it computationally intensive especially for larger networks or images with many channels.\n   \n   - **Depthwise Separable Convolutions**: This technique breaks the convolution into two steps: a depthwise convolution followed by a pointwise convolution. In the depthwise convolution step, a single filter is applied per input channel, which reduces the total number of operations. Specifically, if you have \\( C_{in} \\) channels, the computational cost for this step is just \\( H \\times W \\times C_{in} \\). Following this, the pointwise convolution, which is essentially a \\( 1 \\times 1 \\) convolution applied across all channels, introduces an additional cost of \\( C_{in} \\times K \\). The combined computational cost for a depthwise separable convolution can thus be represented as:\n\n   \\[\n   H \\times W \\times C_{in} + C_{in} \\times K\n   \\]\n\n2. **Comparison**:\n   - Depthwise separable convolutions significantly reduce the computational load compared to traditional convolutions. For instance, if both methods are employed in networks with high dimensional feature maps and a large number of channels, the reduction in operations can be substantial, leading to faster training times and less resource consumption.\n   - Another crucial difference is in the parameter count. Traditional convolutions tend to create more parameters due to the full interaction of filters with all input channels, while depthwise separable convolutions greatly decrease parameter count, which can help mitigate overfitting and improve generalization in models.\n  \nIn conclusion, depthwise separable convolutions offer a more efficient alternative to traditional convolutions, requiring fewer computations and parameters while maintaining a comparable level of representation capability. This makes them particularly advantageous in designing lightweight models, especially in environments where computational power is limited, such as mobile or embedded devices.",

          "answer": "Xception, introduced by Francois Chollet, presents a novel approach to feature extraction through its utilization of depthwise separable convolutions, setting it apart from traditional Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs).\n\n### Breakdown of the Feature Extraction Process\n\n1. **Traditional CNN Approach**:\n   - **Standard Convolutions**: Traditional CNNs employ standard convolutional layers that combine different input channels into output channels through filters, where each filter processes all input channels simultaneously. This results in a computationally intensive process, leading to increased parameters and higher resource consumption.\n   - **Feature Learning**: In traditional CNNs, feature extraction occurs at each layer as convolutional filters learn spatial hierarchies of features, where subsequent layers build on the features learned by previous ones.\n\n2. **Xception Approach**:\n   - **Depthwise Separable Convolutions**: Xception introduces depthwise separable convolutions, which decompose the standard convolution into two simpler operations:\n     - **Depthwise Convolution**: This applies a single filter per input channel (or depth), allowing the model to learn channel-specific features independently. It significantly reduces the number of parameters as each filter operates on a single input channel rather than all channels together.\n     - **Pointwise Convolution**: Following the depthwise convolution, a pointwise convolution (1x1 convolution) is applied to combine the outputs from the depthwise layer across all channels. This step effectively mixes the learned features from the depthwise layer, allowing for richer feature representation.\n   - **Efficiency**: By separating the spatial and channel-wise feature extraction components, Xception offers a more efficient mechanism for feature learning. It reduces the computational cost significantly compared to traditional CNNs while maintaining or improving model performance.\n   - **Linear Complexity**: As a result of using depthwise separable convolutions, the complexity is linear with regard to the input size and the number of filters, unlike traditional methods whose complexity increases quadratically.\n\n### Comparison:\n- **Parameter Count**: Xception's architecture typically contains fewer parameters than traditional CNNs for the same level of task complexity because of the decoupled nature of feature extraction processes.\n- **Performance**: The ability to learn more robust features while reducing computational burden leads to better performance metrics on various deep learning benchmarks.\n- **Architectural Design**: Xception's design is motivated by the Inception module but extends it further by employing depthwise separable convolutions throughout the network, resulting in a deeper and more efficient model than traditional CNNs.\n\nIn summary, Xception revolutionizes feature extraction by utilizing depthwise separable convolutions, which results in a more efficient and effective learning process compared to the standard convolutional layers used in traditional CNNs.

This architecture allows for a significant reduction in computational cost and model size when compared to standard convolutions, which apply multiple filters across all input channels simultaneously.\n\nOne of the primary advantages of depthwise separable convolutions is their efficiency.

By effectively reducing the number of parameters while preserving the expressiveness of the model, these convolutions strike a balance between complexity and performance that is appealing in the context of modern deep learning applications.\n\nIn conclusion, depthwise separable convolutions represent a significant advancement in efficient neural network design, enabling deeper and more complex models without a proportional increase in computational burden.

          "answer": "To assess whether the gains in efficiency from depthwise separable convolutions justify their complexity, we must consider several factors outlined in the document by Francois Chollet regarding the Xception architecture.\n\nDepthwise separable convolutions consist of two main components: a depthwise convolution and a pointwise convolution. The depthwise convolution applies a single filter to each input channel separately, while the pointwise convolution combines the outputs of the depthwise step. This separation leads to several advantages.\n\n1. **Reduction in Computational Load**: One of the primary gains in efficiency from depthwise separable convolutions is the significant reduction in the number of parameters and computations compared to traditional convolutions. Traditional convolutions require a filter to learn the relationship across all input channels simultaneously, resulting in a high computational burden. In contrast, depthwise separable convolutions reduce the complexity from O(n^2 * m * d) to O(n * m + d), where 'n' is the spatial dimensions, 'm' is the number of filters, and 'd' is the depth of input features. This leads to faster training times and less memory usage.\n\n2. **Preservation of Representational Power**: Despite their reduced complexity, depthwise separable convolutions maintain a similar level of representational power as traditional convolutions. The pointwise convolution compensates for the lost interaction between channels in the depthwise step. This balance ensures that while we gain efficiency, we do not sacrifice performance regarding feature extraction and learning capability.\n\n3. **Practical Implications**: In practical applications, such as mobile and resource-constrained environments, the efficiency gain is particularly crucial. According to the document, models incorporating depthwise separable convolutions, like Xception, achieve state-of-the-art performance on various benchmarks while being significantly lighter than their traditional counterparts.\n\n4. **Complexity Considerations**: While depthwise separable convolutions are more complex in terms of architecture design, involving a two-step process instead of a single convolution step, this complexity is mitigated by the efficiency gains during execution. The overall time and resources saved during training and inference often outweigh the initial architectural design considerations.\n\nIn conclusion, the gains in efficiency from using depthwise separable convolutions indeed justify their complexity. They provide a compelling trade-off by reducing computational load and memory usage while still being able to capture and learn complex patterns effectively. This balance is especially beneficial in modern applications where computational resources are often limited. Thus, adopting depthwise separable convolutions can be seen as a smart strategy in building efficient deep learning models.",

          "answer": "To evaluate the potential limitations of the Xception architecture based on its architectural design, we need to consider several factors highlighted in the document itself.\n\n1. **Complexity of Implementation**: Xception utilizes depthwise separable convolutions, which introduce complexity in terms of the implementation of the model. While this design improves efficiency and reduces the number of parameters in comparison to traditional convolutional layers, the increase in architectural complexity may pose challenges for developers who need to optimize and implement the model effectively in various environments.\n\n2. **Computational Demands**: While Xception is designed to be more efficient than standard convolutional neural networks by processing inputs using depthwise separable convolutions, training such a model may still require significant computational resources. This could limit its accessibility for laboratories or organizations with constrained computational capabilities.\n\n3. **Sensitivity to Hyperparameters**: The architecture of Xception, like many deep learning models, may be sensitive to the choice of hyperparameters. This sensitivity could lead to performance variability across different datasets or tasks, necessitating extensive tuning to achieve optimal results. Users might find the requirement for careful hyperparameter tuning to be a limiting factor, especially in rapid prototyping scenarios.\n\n4. **Overfitting Risks**: Due to the depth and complexity of the architecture with its high capacity to learn intricate patterns, there is a potential risk of overfitting, particularly when the model is trained on smaller datasets. This could lead to diminished generalization performance when exposed to new, unseen data.\n\n5. **Transfer Learning Considerations**: While Xception can be used for transfer learning, the performance of pre-trained models may not be as robust across very different datasets. If the pre-training data does not closely match the target application, the benefits of transfer learning could be suboptimal, thus limiting its applicability in certain contexts.\n\n6. **Applicability to Specific Tasks**: The architectural design may also impose limitations in certain domains where computational efficiency and speed are paramount. In applications such as real-time image processing or mobile devices, the overhead from the complexity of the Xception architecture may be a barrier.\n\nIn summary, while Xception offers significant advantages such as reduced parameter count and improved efficiency through its architectural design, it also presents limitations related to implementation complexity, computational demands, sensitivity to hyperparameters, risks of overfitting, transfer learning effectiveness, and applicability to specific use cases.

          "answer": "Depthwise separable convolutions differ from traditional convolutions primarily in how they perform the convolution operation, resulting in a reduction of computational complexity and an increase in efficiency.\n\nIn traditional convolutions, a filter (or kernel) is applied to the entire input feature map. This involves convolving each input channel with the kernel, combining them into a single output channel. Thus, for each output channel, the computation is intensive as it requires multiple convolutions across all input channels, leading to a higher number of parameters and greater computational load.\n\nIn contrast, depthwise separable convolutions break the convolution process into two distinct layers: a depthwise convolution and a pointwise convolution. \n\n1. **Depthwise Convolution**: This step applies a single filter to each input channel independently. Every filter operates on a single channel, which means that the complexity is significantly reduced because there are no cross-channel interactions at this stage.\n   \n2. **Pointwise Convolution**: Following the depthwise convolution, pointwise convolution involves a 1x1 convolution across all the output channels from the depthwise step. This allows the model to combine the outputs from the depthwise layer by mixing the information from different channels.\n\nThe result of this separation is that depthwise separable convolutions drastically cut down the number of parameters and computations when compared to traditional convolutions. For example, if a traditional convolution uses a filter size of 3x3 with 16 filters across 32 input channels, it would require significantly more computations than using depthwise separable convolutions, where each filter in the depthwise step acts independently. Consequently, depthwise separable convolutions are often preferred for building lightweight, efficient deep learning models, as they maintain a similar level of performance while being computationally less demanding.",

This separation significantly reduces the number of parameters compared to traditional convolutions. Fewer parameters lead to lower memory usage, making the model more efficient and quicker to train.\n\n2. **Computational Efficiency**: Due to the reduced number of parameters, depthwise separable convolutions also lower the computational cost involved in training and inference. The two-step process allows models to maintain good performance while being less computationally intensive, enabling faster processing times and the feasibility of deploying models on resource-constrained devices.\n\n3. **Improved Regularization**: By decreasing the number of parameters, depthwise separable convolutions help mitigate the risk of overfitting. This is particularly advantageous when the dataset size is limited, as the model can generalize better with fewer parameters.\n\n4. **Maintained Performance**: Despite their efficiency in terms of parameters and computation, depthwise separable convolutions can maintain competitive performance. The separable nature allows for capturing spatial correlations effectively while still being lightweight, thus maintaining the model’s predictive capabilities.\n\n4. **Facilitation of Deep Architectures**: The reduced complexity allows for the development of deeper architectures without the commensurate increase in computational burden. Deeper networks often provide better representations for data, and depthwise separable convolutions enable researchers to explore deeper models while still managing resource constraints effectively.\n\nIn summary, depthwise separable convolutions offer significant advantages in terms of parameter and computational efficiency, improved regularization, effective performance, and the facilitation of deeper network architectures, making them a valuable tool in deep learning.",

Depthwise separable convolutions are a form of convolutional layer that significantly reduces the model's complexity while maintaining performance. This is achieved through a two-step process: a depthwise convolution followed by a pointwise convolution.\n\nHere is a step-by-step approach to applying depthwise separable convolutions:\n\n1. **Understanding Input Dimensions**: First, analyze the input data dimensions. In high-dimensional datasets, such as images with multiple channels (e.g., color images with RGB channels), depthwise separable convolutions can help exploit spatial features while managing computational load.\n\n2. **Depthwise Convolution**: Implement the depthwise convolution, which applies a single convolutional filter for each input channel separately. This means that if your input has `C` channels, `C` different convolutional filters (each of size `k x k`) are applied to the respective channels. This step effectively captures features within each channel without combining information from different channels.\n\n   - **Kernel Size**: Choose the appropriate kernel size (e.g., 3x3) for the depthwise operation, as used in the Xception architecture. \n\n3. **Pointwise Convolution**: After the depthwise operation, use a pointwise convolution (1x1 convolution) to combine the outputs from the depthwise step. This involves using a set of 1x1 convolutional filters to integrate the information across all channels.\n\n   - **Filter Count**: The number of filters used in the pointwise convolution layer can increase the model's capacity while keeping the total number of parameters low. It's essential to balance between sufficient feature extraction and maintaining computational efficiency, especially in high-dimensional spaces.\n\n4. **Non-linear Activation**: Apply a non-linear activation function (such as ReLU) after both the depthwise and pointwise convolutions to introduce non-linearity into the network, aiding in learning complex representations.\n\n5. **Batch Normalization**: Incorporate batch normalization after each convolutional layer (both depthwise and pointwise) to stabilize learning and improve convergence rates. This is aligned with practices presented in the Xception paper.\n\n6. **Pooling and Downsampling**: To reduce the dimensionality further and capture more abstract features, you can integrate pooling layers (e.g., max pooling or average pooling) after the depthwise separable convolution blocks.\n\n7. **Stacking Layers**: Stack multiple depthwise separable convolution blocks to build a deep model architecture. The Xception framework emphasizes that stacking is critical for capturing hierarchical feature representations efficiently.\n\n8. **Training and Tuning**: Train the neural network on your high-dimensional dataset using an appropriate loss function and optimization algorithm. Monitor performance and adjust parameters (like learning rate) as necessary for effective convergence.\n\n9. **Evaluation**: Finally, evaluate the model's performance on your dataset, ensuring that the depthwise separable convolutions have effectively managed the high dimensionality while still enabling robust feature extraction.\n\nBy following these steps, you can effectively implement depthwise separable convolutions on high-dimensional datasets, leveraging the principles presented in the Xception paper to achieve a compact and efficient neural network architecture.",

This requires a substantial amount of computation and memory, particularly as the network layers increase in size and complexity. The computational cost associated with standard convolutions can be quantified by the formula \\(O(C_{out} \\times C_{in} \\times K \\times K \\times H \\times W)\\), where \\(C_{out}\\) is the number of output channels, \\(C_{in}\\) is the number of input channels, \\(K\\) is the kernel size, and \\(H\\) and \\(W\\) are the height and width of the input feature maps. This demonstrates a high degree of complexity as it scales with both the number of input and output channels.\n\nIn contrast, depthwise separable convolutions, as introduced in the Xception architecture, break the convolution operation into two distinct phases: a depthwise convolution and a pointwise convolution. The depthwise convolution applies a separate filter for each input channel, which greatly reduces the number of computations. Following this, the pointwise convolution (a \\(1 \\times 1\\) convolution) mixes the outputs of the depthwise convolution across the channels. The computational cost for depthwise separable convolutions can be expressed as \\(O(C_{in} \\times K \\times K \\times H \\times W) + O(C_{out} \\times C_{in} \\times H \\times W)\\). This illustrates that while depthwise separable convolutions require fewer computations for the depthwise phase, the overall efficiency also comes from significantly reducing the parameters involved in the pointwise convolution.\n\nIn summary, depthwise separable convolutions are more computationally efficient than standard convolutions. The division into separate depthwise and pointwise convolutions decreases both the number of required multiplications and the memory needed for storing weights. This efficiency is particularly beneficial for deploying deep learning models on devices with limited computational resources, thus highlighting the advantages of using depthwise separable convolutions in modern architectures.",
