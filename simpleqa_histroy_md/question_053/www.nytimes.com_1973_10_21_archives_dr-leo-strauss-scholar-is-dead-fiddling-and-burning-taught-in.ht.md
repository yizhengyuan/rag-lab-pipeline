Leo Strauss, an influential political philosopher and interpreter of classical political theory, died Thursday of pneumonia at Anne Arundel General Hospital in Annapolis, Md. He was 74 years old and lived in Annapolis.

For the last four years, Dr. Strauss had been the Scott Buchanan Scholar in Residence at St. John's College in Annapolis, where he taught advanced seminars In political theory. A teacher of several generations of political scientists, he wrote books for other scholars rather than for the general public, and he was not widely known outside his field.

But one of his colleagues noted that within the profession Dr. Strauss is credited with keeping the study of the political classics alive and for showing students that thinkers such as Plato, Machiavelli and Hobbes were relevant to presentday political dilemmas at a time when the quantitative and behavioral approaches to political science were more fashionable.

**Fiddling and Burning**

In one critique of behavioral political science, published in 1962, Dr. Strauss wrote: “Only a great fool would call the new political science diabolic It is not even Machiavellian, for Machiavelli's teaching was graceful, subtle and colorful. Nor is it Neronian. Nevertheless, one may say of it that it fiddles while Rome burns, It is excused by two facts: it does not know that it fiddles and it does not know that Rome burns.

The study of the classics of political philosophy has since undergone a resurgence in the universities; due in substantial measure to Dr. Strauss's work.

He was born in Kirchhain, Germany, on Sept. 20, 1899, served in the German army during World War I, and received his Ph.D. from Hamburg University. Dr. Strauss and his wife, the former Miriam Bernson, came to the United States in 1938. He joined the university in exile of the New School for Social Research, gathering of Nazi‐persecuted scholars, founded by Dr. Alvin Johnson, which later formed the New School's graduate faculty.

**Taught in Chicago**

In 1949, Dr. Strauss went to the University of Chicago, where he taught for 18 years, the last 8 as the Robert M. Hutchins Distingushed Service Professor of Political Science. Before joining the faculty at St. John's, he taught for two years at Claremont Men's College in California.

Dr. Strauss was the author of books on the works of Hobbes, Machiavelli, Spinoza, Socrates and Aristophanes, as well as on issues in political theory. In reviewing one of his books, “On Tyranny,” in The New York Times Book Review, John Herman Randall Jr., professor of philosophy at Columbia, wrote:

“Leo Strauss is a scholar who knows his own mind. Impatient bof all academic reservations and shilly‐shallying, he has the courage of his prejudices. He is convinced that he knows the truth. Fortunately, he is usually right.”

Dr. Strauss leaves, besides his wife, a daughter, Jenny Clay; a son, Thomas, and three grandchildren.
