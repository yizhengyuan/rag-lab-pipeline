###### A Medical Leader who knows how to listen and when to reach out.

  * Who can work with the latest equipment as well as with limited resources.
  * Who is eager to question and discover better solutions.
  * Who collaborates with fellow experts to ensure the best outcome.
  * Who is driven by fierce compassion.
  * Who isn't just an expert, but an empathetic expert.
  * Who knows the art of prevention, rehabilitation and cure.
  * Who goes beyond commitment to make connections.
  * Because the patient is not a condition, But a person.



To meet the need of training the next generation of doctors, the Ramaiah Medical College Hospital (RMCH) was set up on the campus in 1984. The Hospital accommodates 1,380 beds and offers all Broad speciality and Super specialty services.

At RMC, we strive to nurture a well-rounded professional. Here, our focus is on building doctors with a strong, comprehensive foundation of medical knowledge. Our students learn through rigorous academics and a balanced focus on extra-curricular activities. They learn to practice in well-equipped hospital as well as in the rural and urban field practice areas. They learn to make decisions independently and when to collaborate with a fellow student of nursing, physiotherapy or pharmacy.

At RMC, we support students to initiate, organise and participate in co-curricular activities. Because we believe a Medical Leader needs skills that go beyond treatment and cure.

**The Ramaiah Group of Institutions was founded by our Founder Chairman, Late Sri. M S Ramaiah.**
