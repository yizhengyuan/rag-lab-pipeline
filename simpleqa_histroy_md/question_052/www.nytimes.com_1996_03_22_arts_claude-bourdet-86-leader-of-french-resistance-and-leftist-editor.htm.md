Claude Bourdet, a Resistance leader who emerged a starveling from the Nazi concentration camp at Buchenwald to become a leader of France's postwar non-Communist left, died yesterday at his home in Paris. He was 86.

A founder of the newspaper Combat and the political weekly L'Observateur, Mr. Bourdet was one of only a few hundred heroes to be designated a Compagnon de la Liberation by Charles de Gaulle for his membership in the National Resistance Council and his leadership of the Resistance movement Combat.

He was also an outspoken intellectual and cold-war neutralist unafraid to condemn French repression in Algeria and a resurgence of French anti-Semitism.

On a spring dawn in 1956, when Mr. Bourdet was editor of L'Observateur, he was arrested at his home, handcuffed and hauled off to be strip-searched at Fresnes Prison, where the Gestapo had taken him upon his arrest in 1944. The 1956 seizure followed a series of articles in which Mr. Bourdet attacked the French campaign to destroy the guerrillas battling for Algerian independence and condemned plans to call up 100,000 military reservists.

"One hundred thousand young Frenchmen are threatened with being thrown into the 'dirty war' of Algeria, with losing the best years of their lives, perhaps with being wounded, indeed killed, for a cause that few among them approve, in a kind of combat that revolts most of them," he wrote.

At sundown Mr. Bourdet was released, and in his first post-prison editorial, he observed: "When somebody rings your bell at 6 A.M. and it is the milkman, you are in a democracy."
