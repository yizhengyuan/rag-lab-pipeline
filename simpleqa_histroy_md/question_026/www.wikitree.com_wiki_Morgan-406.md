##  History 

"Among the Welsh Quakers was a family of Morgans. In 1720 Squire Boone, a son of George and Mary (Maugridge) Boone married Sarah Morgan. A Welch American planter of note who came early to Pennsylvania was Edward Morgan, the grandfather of two great Americans: Daniel Boone of Kentucky, son of Squire and Sarah (Morgan) Boone and Gen. Daniel Morgan, according to Quaker records. [1]

"Every effort has been made to learn something of the ancestry of Sarah Morgan, wife of Squire Boone but without appreciable results. It is claimed, of course, that Sarah's father was Edward Morgan of Gwynedd, Philadelphia, PA., and her marriage record shows that fact beyond all doubt. It is also reasonably certain that her brothers and sisters were the young Morgans, whose marriage records like her own, state that they were children of Edward Morgan of Gwynedd. Beyond these facts there is nothing authentic upon which to base any statement connecting Sarah (Morgan) Boone with any other Morgan family record. In "Life of Gen. Daniel Morgan of the Virginia line" by James Graham we find, "It is interesting to know that these two famous fighters of the Revolutionary period, Daniel Morgan and Daniel Boone were first cousins, but we have found no adequate proof of this connection." [1]

"The marriage of Edward Morgan's children into the great Welch families indicates that they, Daniel Boone and Gen. Daniel Morgan, are connected by blood. Recorded marriages of Edward Morgan's children are as follows: There might have been other children. "[1]

  1. 1710 Elizabeth Morgan married Cadwallader Morris 
  2. 1713 Margaret Morgan married Samuel Thomas 
  3. 1718 Daniel Morgan married Elizabeth Roberts 
  4. 1720 Sarah Morgan (born 1704) married Squire Boone 
  5. 1721 John Morgan married Sarah LLoyd 
  6. 1728 Joseph Morgan married Elizabeth Lloyd 
  7. 1731 William Morgan (widower) married Catherine Robinson 



Sarah married Squire Boone on July 26, 1720 in Chester, Pennsylvania. [2] [3][4]

" Their marriage was in the Gwynedd (Quaker) Meeting House. The location then in Philadelphia Co is now part of Montgomery Co.

Sarah Jarman Morgan married Squire Boone and their son is Daniel Boone. Morgan-406 and Boone-2080 need to be merged, as they are the same person. Obviously, Sarah's LNAB is not Boone. She married Boone.
