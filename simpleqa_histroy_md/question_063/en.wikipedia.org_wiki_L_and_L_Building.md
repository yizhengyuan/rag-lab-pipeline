The **L and L Building** is a historic two-story building in Billings, Montana. It was designed in the Italianate style, and built in 1893-1896 by Sam and Yee Quong Lee, two brothers who were born in China and emigrated to the United States in 1865.[2] It housed a dry goods store, a restaurant, and a lodging house until the late 1910s, when the first floor was remodelled as a saloon and a liquor store.[2] It later housed the Arcade Bar,[2] which became known as "an eyesore and a gathering spot for the city's criminal underbelly,"[3] The bar closed temporarily after it was raided by the police, who arrested a bartender and two customers on marijuana charges in January 1993,[4] and it closed down in May 1994.[5] The building was refurbished in 2004–2006.[2] It has been listed on the National Register of Historic Places since December 19, 2008.[1]
