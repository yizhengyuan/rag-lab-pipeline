**TCG _Yavuz_ (F 240)** is the lead ship of _Yavuz_ -class frigate of the Turkish Navy. 

## Development and design

[edit]

Main article: Yavuz-class frigate

_Yavuz_ -class frigates were designed in Germany and are part of the MEKO family of modular warships; in this case the MEKO 200 design. An order for ships was signed by the Turkish government in April 1983 for four MEKO frigates. Two ships were built in Germany and two in Turkey with German assistance. They are similar in design to the larger _Barbaros_ -class frigates of the Turkish Navy, which are improved versions of the _Yavuz_ -class frigate. 

The Turkish Navy has an ongoing limited modernization project for an electronic warfare suite. The intent is to upgrade the ships with locally produced ECM, ECCM systems, active decoys, LWRs, IRST, and the necessary user interface systems. 

## Construction and career

[edit]

_Yavuz_ was launched on 30 May 1985 by Blohm+Voss in Hamburg and commissioned on 11 October 1987.[1]

On 11 September 2020, she escorted TCG  _İskenderun_ in the Mediterranean while on her way to the Port of Marmaris.[2]
