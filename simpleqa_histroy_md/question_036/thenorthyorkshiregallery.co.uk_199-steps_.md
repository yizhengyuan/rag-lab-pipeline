## But What Makes Whitby So Special?

There are several iconic locations to visit in Whitby but arguably the most talked about is the famous Whitby 199 Steps.

Anyone who has ever visited this Yorkshire town will know about Whitby 199 steps or church stairs as they’re also described. This iconic flight of stairs reputed to have been used by St Hilda leads up from the old town of Whitby to the ruined Abbey above, offering breathtaking views of the coastline.

The 199 steps are believed to date back to the 13th century, and today they are a firm favourite with visitors and locals alike. For many people, the highlight of their trip to Whitby is the climb to the top of the steps, where they can enjoy spectacular views of the town, harbour, and sea. Whether you’re looking for a challenging workout or simply a way to take in the sights of Whitby, the 199 steps are worth a visit.

## **A Brief History The 199 Steps**

199 steps sound’s like a lot, but it’s a pretty manageable hike – especially when you know the history behind it. The steps leading up to the ruins of Whitby Abbey have been around since 1370! and they’ve been used for everything from pilgrims practicing their Christian faith to a burial route to St Mary’s churchyard.

Over the centuries, the steps have undergone several changes with the old wooden planks have been replaced with stone from nearby Sneaton in 1774. In the early 20th century, the steps were restored to their current state.

While the exact history of the 199 steps is a bit of a mystery, there’s no doubt that they’ve played an important role in Whitby’s history.

## How Long Does It Take To Climb The 199 Steps In Whitby?

The climb up should only take 5 minutes at a steady pace, once at the graveyard turn to find breathtaking views of the town, luckily the ascent is broken by several well-placed benches.

## 199 Steps Coffin Benches

Nestled atop a hill in the picturesque town of Whitby, St Mary’s Church. For centuries, the church has been a popular site for burials, and it is said that over 1,000 bodies are interred in its churchyard.

In the 19th century, a tradition developed whereby the body would be carried up the church’s 199 steps before being laid to rest. This was no easy feat, and so a series of seats were installed on the steps to give the pall bearers a respectable place to rest coffins. Today, the pall bearers benches are still in place, and they offer visitors a unique glimpse into the past.

When you next visit Whitby on the way to St Mary’s Church, be sure to take a moment to sit on one of the benches and imagine what it would have been like to carry a coffin up the steps!

## Whitby’s Famous Steps: Worth The Climb?

In short yes absolutely!. If you visit Whitby, chances are you’ll want to climb the town’s famous steps. These steps lead up from Church Street to the ruins of Whitby Abbey and offer the most spectacular views over the harbour and across the sea.

At the top of the 199 steps can also be found the church of St Mary.

## Dracula

There is a strong connection between Dracula and Whitby. In Bram Stoker’s novel, Dracula arrives in Whitby by ship and climbs the 199 steps to the ruined abbey, where he is finally destroyed. This scene is often cited as one of the most memorable in the entire book.

And it is not hard to see how Whitby 199 Steps inspired Bram Stoker, who must have spend time exploring the old donkey track and graveyard of Whitby. If you’re a fan of Dracula, or simply looking for a unique way to experience Whitby, be sure to take the climb up the 199 steps. You might just feel like you’re stepping into a page of history!

## The Donkey Road

Equally, as challenging is the Donkey road, this steep and cobbled path leads up to Whitby Abbey and the top of the East Cliff. This is where Dracula climbs as a black dog in the novel, making it a very significant location. The track gets its name from the fact that beach donkeys used to walk up and down it every day, carrying small children.

## 199 Steps Seems Like A Lot, Are You Sure That’s Right? 

There’s an old debate going on about Whitby Steps how many steps, and whether there are 199 steps or 200. Many count 198, while others claim that they count 191 and even 20th-century guidebooks mention 194 as well!

I suppose the only real way of knowing is to count them for yourself although there are Roman numerals carved in every 10 steps which may be some assistance.

## When Is The Best Time To Climb The 199 Steps?

The steps can get pretty busy, but morning or evening offers the best chance of climbing them peacefully. Avoiding the steps in bad weather may be helpful, but if you’re lucky enough to catch them in the snow, it’s one of the most beautiful winter scenes in all of Yorkshire and perhaps the UK! Keep an eye on The Whitby Guide to better plan your visit.

## Where Are The 199 Steps in Whitby

The 199 steps Whitby are located on the east side of the river Esk. They start where the old cobbled road of church Street meets Henrietta Street.

## Photography On The 199 Steps

In the Summer months, as the sun begins to set, the steps become a photographer’s paradise. With a view of Church Street below and the flowers hanging over the step’s cast iron railings, it’s easy to see why this picturesque spot is so popular. But it’s not just the views that make this place special. The sunset over the sea is simply breathtaking and makes for the perfect photo opportunity.

Another photo opportunity presents itself towards the very bottom of the steps as Church Street meets Henrietta Street. The vista looking towards Whitby Whalebones and across the harbour mouth it’s something to behold.

The view from Whitby’s west cliff is just as beautiful, if not more so than the view from the top of the East Cliff. Looking back through the whalebones you can see the 199 steps rising from the old Whitby towards the abbey above. It’s an amazing sight that you won’t want to miss!

Whitby black and white photography works exceptionally well around the foot of the 199 Steps, particularly along the cobbled streets of Church Street and the historic yards that lead off it.
