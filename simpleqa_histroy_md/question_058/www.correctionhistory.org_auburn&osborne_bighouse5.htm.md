**Ch. 13:_Sing Sing Now_** **As Sing Sing enters its third century of continuous operation, it houses more than 2,000 inmates and employs approximately 1,000 people. More than 5,000 visitors pass through its gates each month. . . . In 1989, the institution was accredited for the first time by the American Correctional Association, which established a set of national standards by which every correctional facility should be judged. . . . Films like _The Big House_(1930), _Angels With Dirty Faces_ (1938) and _20,000 Years at Sing Sing_ (1932) helped to form an image of the prison in the public mind that exists even today. Numerous celebrities have visited the facility and some have become part of the folklore of the institution. President Abraham Lincoln, James Cagney, Victor Mature, Mayor Jimmy Walker, Spencer Tracy and many more have stood inside Sing Sing's marble walls . . . . New York Yankees played the New York Giants [at Sing Sing in 1925] and during the game, Ruth blasted a home run over the right field wall, which was said to be 620 feet . . . . Sing Sing no longer resembles the prison constructed by Captain Elam Lynds and the Auburn inmates in 1825. Though the original structure still stands, it does not and never will house prisoners again. Plans are presently underway to convert the huge structure into a museum, an idea which may soon become a reality.  |  **_Sing Sing Tower (photo by author)_ **

An economic study prepared in 2002 indicated a prison museum would bring between 100,000 to 210,000 visitors to the area and generate $20 million annually to Westchester County. . . .
