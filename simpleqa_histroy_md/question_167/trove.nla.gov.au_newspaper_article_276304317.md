NELSON'S LADY HAMILTON WON FAME

BY SHARING MUD BATH WITH "QUACK"

A N audience of London s aristocracy gathered in a house in Pall

7" Mall one afternoonin 1 78 L Before them was a huge tub of steams

1 feg black mud from which protruded, mushroom Jikej

man and a woman. I he man s voice droned

on about the health-giving effects of hot mud,

but no-one watched him. AH eyes were on

the woman's face, flushed with the heat and

surmounted by an elaborate coiffure laced with, strings of pearls. It

was the most beautiful face in London — that of Emma Lyon, soon to

become Lady Hamilton and mistress of England's one-eved sea-

genius, Admiral Horatio Nelson.

was not buried to the neck

.in mud becausev she liked it.

She was earning a living. In

later: years Lady Emma would

gladly have forgotten she was

ever the assistant of the man who

shared her mud-bath— Dr. James

Graham, who wrung a fortune

from the credulous with one of

the most outrageous frauds; in the

history of quack medicine. ;

Dr. Graham's- venture Into the

cure-all trade wasvwell ahead of

his time. He offered his clientele

a shrewd mixture of orthodox

medicine, religion, i bally-hoo, sex

and mysticism— a formula which

is successful even today.

He was born in Edinburgh in

1745, the son of a struggling sad

dler. , By! sheer hard work he

reached i Edinburgh Uriiversity

and studied medicine under

Monro Primus, . Cullen and Black.

There is some 4oubt that he

graduated and was entitled to call

himself "doctor," hut. he was

probably as competent as the

other sawbones of !his time.

In 1772 he went to America and

practised as an ear, nose and

throat . specialist. ; Even then

America was awakening to the

value of advertising, and the

seeds of bally-hoo sank into Gra

ham's mind.

While practising iii Philadel

phia he met Benjamin Franklin

and learned of his experiments

with electricity. The new science

seemed to hold possibilities, both

as a cure for human ills and for

Graham's chronic penury.

Returning to England in 1774

he settled in London. Fortune

favored him. He met Catherine

Macaulay, the famous historian,

who later married his younger

brother, William.

Catherine became his first

guinea-pig. He tried out his new

theory of electric baths and mas

sage with his newly-compounded

"ethereal balsamic balm" on her,

Catherine recovered her health

and - became his best word-of- .

mouth advertiser.,

Graham heard the knocking of

opportunity. His nostrums, ped

dled to all, netted him a small

fortune, but he had bigger things

in mind. He rented a large house

in Pall Mall, opposite St. James ;

Palace, closed the doors mysteri

ously, and set an army of trades

men to work.

In the autumn of 1775 he ex

ploded, his secret on London. Over

the door of his house he hung a

sign: "Templum Aesculapio Sac

rum"— which Londoners soon

translated into "The Temple of

Health." Then he opened an ad-

vertisingcampaign of unheard-

of magnitude.

Magazines and newspapers were

crammed with extravagant claims

and flowery descriptions of the

Temple— especially the chamber

called The. Great Apollo Apart

ment. "On entering which," ran

the advertisement, "words convey

ho adequate idea of the vast and

awful sublimity which seizes the

mmd of every spectator."

The Apollo Apartment was furn-

ished. with every weird device

Graham's fertile mind could con

jure up. .

Sphinxes, fire-breathing; dra

gons and daring sculptures dec

orated the -walls, but the centre

piece was :the Celestial < Throne—

an ornate electric chair connected

to banks of- batteries by a maze

of wires! The Throne was guar

anteed to cure everything from

indigestion to fractured skulls.

Off the main apartment were

bathrooms where faded ladies and

jaded gentlemen could take a

bath in milk, of heated mud shot

through with "revivifying electric

vibrations which recall youth and

rekindle the divine fire of Venus."

> Waiting patients lolled on rich

ly brocaded divans charmed by

'Celestial music" wafted from

cunningly; concealed orchestras.

The Temple was Graham's shop

window. Each demonstration of.

the /'sublime and awful forces"

was followed by a lecture in med-

ical double-talk and a v sale of

balsamic balm, pills and purges.

The sale always ended with a sur

prising statement: "Ladies and

gentlemen may be electrified for

10 guineas."

More electrifying than the Cel

estial- throne was the price of

Graham's Elixir of Life, com

pounded of "rare and mysterious

herbs from the East, known only

to the Sultans and the voluptu

aries of Persia."

The ingredients Were " so rare

that ladies and gentlemen taking

the full course of Elixir were re

quired to pay £1000 in advance to

lay down a stock. ,

Dozens of London's best people

took the Elixir course. The list

was supposed to " be secret, but

gossips soon knew that Lady

Spenser, the Duchess of Devon

shire, and Lady Clermont were

seeking their lost youth at the

Temple.

The Duchess de Polignac made

a special trip from Paris to take

the eure, but all the herbs of the

East were helpless to . repair the

damage her life had done.

Graham mixed a grain of good

advice with his quackery. He de

tected the cause of many of his

Patients' ills and put them on a

strict regimen. . .

He counselled against port, to-

pacco, late nights over the gam

ing tables and "indulgence in

animal appetites." His dissolute

patrons found his advice, at a

guinea, harder to take than his

Elixir at £1000.

When the Temple lost its nov-1

elty Graham stored his parapher

nalia and went to the Continent,

where he practised In Aix-la-Cha-

pelle treating the French .aristoc

racy. In 1778 he was back in

England supervising a mysterious

order from a glass works in New

castle.

The following year he paid

£12,000 for a magnificent house on

Royal Terrace, Adelphi, in the

heart of fashionable London and

opened his new shrine of hum

bug with a bigger fanfare than

the last.

Two Negroes, dressed in snowy

livery delivered handbills from

house to house, and the news

papers were filled with gushing

claims. '

With a true i

nucEs te r 's

genius he gave

the new enter

prise a leaven-

ing of sex by adding the name of

Hymen, the Goddess of Marriage,

to its name..

The Temple of Health and

Hymen outdid its predecessor in

garish splendor. Graham decor

ated the entrance hall with

crutches, walking-sticks, spec

tacles, wheel-chairs and ear-

trumpets, purported to have been

discarded by restored patients.

The centre and shrine of the'

new Temple was the Celestial

Bed, a triumph of the art of Den

ton, the tinman of Coventry St.

. The Bed was his masterpiece.

The front- was ornamented with

a huge gilt sun surmounted by

a statue of Hygeia, the Goddess

of Health. It stood on 28 glass

legs, was covered with the finest

silk damask, and surmounted by

a gilt canopy fringed with tassels

of scarlet silk.

The Celestial Bedchamber was

lined with mirrors so that the

occupants could view themselves

from a dozen different angles.

A mass of glass tubes coming

from another room piped in soft

music, "cherished vapors of orien-

tal perfumes" and "Celestial fire"

from a mysterious cylinder hidden

in a locked cupboard.

According to Graham's adver

tisements, . the Celestial Bed was

an improved copy of. one owned

by the favorite sultana of -the

Grand Turk.

For the delights of the Bed

Graham asked a modest £100 a

night. Married couples were as

sured they would produce "beau

tiful rosy heirs." With shrewd

applied psychology the doctor

warned that repeated tenancy of

the Bed would shorten the life

span. The. added spice of danger

paid off in golden guineas.

Graham made his policy quite

clear in one of his pamphlets:

"Neither I nor any of my people

are entitled to ask who. rests in

this chamber, which I have de

nominated the Holy of .Holies."

To make it doubly clear, he add

ed: "Persons wearing masks ad

mitted."

For two years the Celestial Bed

boomed, the Celestial Throne

electrified gullible invalids at £10

a jolt, and the Ethereal Balm sold

buoyantly. x

Then Graham added another

attraction— a . pretty , nursemaid

whom he noticed wheeling her

charges . along the street. So

Emma Lyon became his assistant.

His advertisements described

her as: "Vestina, the Gigantic,

the , Stupendous Goddess of

Health."

Each night at eight, Emma

clad, in a long white robe which

showed a sufficiently tantalising

portion of her above the - waist,

was. escorted by "the Gentleman

Usher of the Rosy Rod" to the

Celestial Throne.

""Sometimes sh& stood prettily in

the classic pose of the Goddess of

Health,- feeding a stuffed snake

from a gilded bowl; sometimes

she read aloud Graham's pam

phlet on "The cause, nature and

effect of love and beauty." Be

tween times she wallowed with

the doctor in heated mud-baths.

i Into the hodge-podge of sex

i and quackery Graham managed

I to inject a breath of religion. 'He

composed the "Universal Christ-

: ian Prayer, 'L which he encouraged

i his patients "to recite eri masse.

' Not all London, fell for Gra

ham's mumbo-jumbo. At the

height of his popularity George

Colman produced a screamingly

funny farce called, "The Genius

of Nonsense," at the Haymarket

Theatre. . . .. . , - '

John Bannister played the part

of the "Emperor of Quacks." He

had studied Graham's manner

isms and extravagant speech so

closely that the audience had no

doubt about who the Emperor

of Quacks really was. Graham

threatened to sue, but the play

: ran its full season.

In 1781 business waned and

Graham moved the Temple to a

! smaller house in Pall Mall. The

i following year his apparatus was

seized for debt and sold by auc

tion.. The bubble had burst.

The downfall of the Celestial

Bed almost coincided with that of

its designer. Denton, the tinman,

' was convicted of having coining

tools and hanged at Tyburn,, with

Dr. Graham . as a spectator. : -

Graham gave up his London

house and embarked on a' barn-

storming lecture tour of Britain.

In 1783 he gave an address in

Edinburgh and mixed religion and

medicine so freely that the Scots

saw it as an attack on the Estab

lished Church. They forbade a

repetition. <

. A little later Graham published

a letter purported to have been

written by Professor Hope, of -

Edinburgh, approving his medi

cal theories. The Professor de

nounced it as a forgery.

Graham was clapped in the Tol-

booth to explain his "late injuri

ous lectures in this city." He was

freed on the petition of 300 Scots

and left Edinburgh hastily. .

Soon afterwards he began to

pour out a spate of books which

mixed evangelical Christianity,

and health into a meaningless

hodge-podge. He became a strict

vegetarian, who refused "to make

his stomach the grave, the char-

nel house for the bodies of fellow-

creatures."

His pamphlets of 1790 described

how he had buried himself In the

earth for six hours a day, eight

days in succession, eating noth

ing and drinking only cold water.

The same year he set Newcas-

tie a-buzz when

he and an un

named young

lady "stripped

themselves to

their birthday suits" and buried

: themselves up to the neck, claim-

i ing it would improve their health.

. On that occasion a humorous

farmer almost drowned Graham

with a watering can — "to make

him grow." '

Graham was in Newcastle when

he heard that George III had been

seized with his first fit of mental

aberration. He coached to Wind

sor for an interview with the

Prince of Wales.

He told the astonished Prince

that a similar fate would overtake

him unless he married "a .certain

Princess." The Prince enquired

the name of the Princess, and

Graham told him solemnly,

"Evangelical Christianity."

In his last years Graham be

came an undisguised health crank

and religious fanatic. He took to

wearing sods of earth next to his

skin and filling his boots with

mud./;

Graham, the man who had sold

elixir to enable humans to live to

150, died suddenly in Edinburgh,

In 1796; aged 49. Emma Lyon -

went on to greater glasy. ,
