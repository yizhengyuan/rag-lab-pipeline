Quit India Movement Day 2023

The Quit India Movement also known as Bharat Chhodho Andolan was launched at the Bombay session of the All India Congress Committee. This initiative was launched by Mahatma Gandhi in 1942 and August 9 marks the anniversary of Quit India Movement Day. 

The Quit India Movement was a result of many factors that angered the Indians such as the failure of the Cripps Mission, the unapproved growing involvement in World War II, and the repressive policies of the British government. 

This day is celebrated to honour the struggle and efforts for Indian independence that were made by countless men and women who fought against British rule for decades. It is a day to remember their sacrifices and to acknowledge our commitment to freedom, democracy, and non-violence.

> Tributes to the greats who took part in the Quit India Movement. Under the leadership of Gandhi Ji, this Movement played a major role in freeing India from colonial rule. Today, India is saying in one voice:  
>   
> Corruption Quit India.   
>   
> Dynasty Quit India.   
>   
> Appeasement Quit India. pic.twitter.com/w6acXBoNq1

## What Was the Slogan of the Quit India Movement?

The Quit India Movement was powered by two main slogans: "Quit India" and "Do or Die." The "Quit India" slogan was made for the British to leave India and grant the country independence. 

The "Do or Die" slogan was an urge for the Indian people to be ready to sacrifice everything when it comes to fighting for independence. The "Quit India" slogan was coined by Yusuf Meherally who was a socialist leader and member of the Indian National Congress. 

Meherally felt that the slogan was powerful and would connect with Indian people. The slogan quickly caught on and became a motive for the Quit India Movement.

The "Do or Die" slogan was created by Mahatma Gandhi. He felt that the slogan was really necessary as it will inspire the Indian people to take action and fight for their independence. Mahatma Gandhi believed that Indian people were ready to make sacrifices and fight for their freedom, and he wanted to give them the courage to take the next step.

## What Were the Causes of the Quit India Movement?

There were many causes that motivated Indians to fight for their independence: 

**The failure of the Cripps Mission:** The Cripps Mission was a failed attempt by the British government to win Indian support for the war effort. The mission offered India dominion status after the war, but this was not enough for the Indian National Congress, which demanded full independence.

**The Indian involvement in World War II:** Many Indians were forced to fight for a British war that had no relation with them. They also saw this war as an opportunity to weaken the British Empire and move forward with the fight for Indian independence.

**The repressive policies of the British government:** The British government was very repressive in handling the Indian independence movement. This was the reason for the growing sense of anger and frustration among the Indian people.

Following these events, the Quit India Resolution was passed by the All India Congress Committee (AICC) on August 8, 1942, in Bombay. The resolution was moved by Jawaharlal Nehru and seconded by Sardar Patel. The resolution stated the following:

  * The British must quit India immediately.
  * India must be free to shape its own destiny.
  * The Indian National Congress will not cooperate with the British government in any way until independence is granted.
  * The Indian people will use non-violent means to achieve their goal of independence.



The resolution read: _“The committee approves and endorses that resolution and is of opinion that events subsequent to it have given it further justification, have made it clear that an immediate ending of British rule in India is an urgent necessity both for the sake of India and the success of the cause of the United Nations.”_

 _Source: British Library_

To conclude, Quit India Movement Day is a day to remember the sacrifices made by the Indian people in their fight for independence. The movement was met with a harsh response from the British government, but it helped to raise awareness of the Indian independence movement and to strengthen the resolve of the Indian people.
