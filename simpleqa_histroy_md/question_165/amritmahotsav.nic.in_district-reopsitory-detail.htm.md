##  Yusuf Meherally's Slogans for the Freedom Struggle

Mumbai City, Maharashtra

** October 06, 2023 ** to October 06, 2024

The history of the Indian freedom struggle is known for its passive resistance and non-violent mode of protest. However, its 1942 campaign ended up with a slightly aggressive turn in demand. Vociferously asking the British to “Quit India” was a shift in the strategy and tradition of the Indian National Congress from its struggle during the previous decades. Similarly, “Simon Go Back” was another such slogan that resonated loudly in the anti-Simon Commission protests in 1928. Behind such brave demands of “Quit India” and “Simon Go Back” was Yusuf Meherally, a freedom fighter and Congress member.

Yusuf Meherally or Yusuf Meherali, was born to a well-to-do family in Bombay (Mumbai City district), Maharashtra in 1903. During his childhood, Meherally developed a keen interest in books on revolutionary movements which in turn fuelled his curiosity about the nationalist movement. His great-grandfather was one of the pioneers of the textile industry in Bombay during the 19th century. This prosperous background of his family and the revolutionary ideas that he grew up with turned him into both a rebel within the family and a sympathizer of the working class. Despite opposition from his family, Yusuf joined the national movement right after completing his studies at the Bharda High School.

After obtaining a Bachelor’s degree in Economics and History from Elphinstone College, he pursued a law degree at the Government Law College of Bombay. Around the same time, the Simon Commission, the only European commission with no native Indian, arrived in Bombay to suggest constitutional reforms in British India. Opposing this paradoxical injustice, the Bombay Youth League, an organization founded by Yusuf Meherally in 1928, organized protests in the city. They had planned to meet the Commission at the Arabian Sea before the latter reached the port, but the plan was aborted as it was leaked to the police. Undeterred, these fearless young men were not ready to stay calm when injustice was being held. Disguised as coolies, they entered the port and welcomed the Commission with black flags and slogans shouting “Simon Go Back”. This slogan that Meherally coined was taken up by even the leaders of the national movement. The British arrested Meherally and mistreated him, including keeping him inside a drum and rolling it on the road. But he did not let it deter his spirit and described it as a “moving experience.” Though severely attacked by the police, Yusuf and his companions displayed great courage and the city observed hartals in solidarity with their struggle. Even Gandhi recognized his courageous protest. Enraged by the protests, the British administration proceeded to retaliate by debarring him from practicing law, a punishment seldom meted out to Indian lawyers. 

The slogan “Simon Go Back”, which was coined by Yusuf Meherally upon the Commission’s arrival in Bombay, echoed throughout their journey in various parts of the Subcontinent. From a kite with a “Go Back” slogan during a tea party in Lucknow Baradari Maidan to a motorboat with another “Go Back” slogan in the ghats of Benaras (Varanasi), the people across the subcontinent embraced the slogan wholeheartedly. The United Province Pradesh Congress Committee even kept souvenirs like the kite as their prized possessions.

During the Disobedience Movement in 1930, Yusuf Meherally played an important role in leading the campaign among the youth of Bombay and taking charge of the entire movement in the city after its leaders courted imprisonment. However, Meherally was also arrested and imprisoned for four months. In a conspiracy case, he was sentenced again to two years imprisonment in 1932 at Nasik prison, where he came into contact with socialist leaders. Along with Jayaprakash Narayan, Asok Mehta, Narendra Dev, Achyut Patwadhan, Minoo Masani, and several others, Yusuf Meherally founded the Congress Socialist Party after his release in 1934. With class solidarities like farmers' cooperatives and trade unions, they aimed at the economic empowerment of the masses.

While leading an Indian delegation to the World Youth Congress in New York and the World Cultural Conference in Mexico, Yusuf Meherally realized the lack of literature on contemporary issues in India. This ed him to write a series of books titled _Leaders of India_ and other current topics translated into Gujarati, Hindi, and Urdu. In the preface of one of his books, he emphasized the reason why he started writing on contemporary issues and introduced periodical writings. Despite his literary pursuit, he remained committed to the struggle for the nation, getting arrested several times for violating government orders and for offering Individual Satyagraha.

During one of his jail terms in 1942, Yusuf Meherally was nominated as the mayor of Bombay. Supporting the nomination, Sardar Patel realized the necessity of bringing this young man to the forefront of the Indian National Congress. Upon his release, Yusuf Meherally won the election with ease and became the youngest mayor of the Bombay Municipal Corporation. Rewarding his great administrative skills and people-centric approach, Meherally soon found a place in the hearts of the common people for his popular civic administration. He introduced a quick file dispatch system and reprimanded irresponsible officials in the city municipal administration. He was completely aware of the value of the penny that he was authorized to spend on behalf of the city. The Bombay Municipal Corporation, under his mayoralty, refused to pay Rs 24 lakh for the Air Raid Precaution (ARP) scheme of the British government. It was meant to fund the protection of civilians under the pretext of an air attack. Yusuf Meherally pointed out that the authorities must have the courage and defend the city from such catastrophes unlike what happened in Malaya and Burma, where the British fled the place leaving its civilians to die at the hands of the Japanese. This move was seen as both an attack on the irresponsibility of the British colonial empire and safeguarding India’s civil rights. But Yusuf Meherally did not put people’s lives at risk as Bombay Municipal Corporation became the only city administration in India to form its own ARP scheme with Indians in it and a People’s Volunteer Brigade as well. 

While he was furthering the struggle for Indian independence, discussions were underway in Bombay for nationwide civil disobedience in 1942. Mahatma Gandhi sought suggestions for the best slogan to be used throughout the campaign from his close associates and foremost leaders of the Indian National Congress. Several leaders like C Rajagopalachari suggested “Retreat” and “Withdraw”. Others suggested “Get Out,” but Gandhi rejected it. Soon, Meherally came up with “Quit India,” highlighting a polite yet firm demand from Indians that the British immediately leave the Indian territory. Gandhi approved the slogan and Yusuf Meherally published his book titled _Quit India_ prior to the movement, which was sold out within weeks. Preparing the ground for the movement, he printed several Quit India badges, thus popularising the campaign slogan among the public before the August 8th meeting in Bombay. 

The movement turned out to be a huge success as it found momentum in every part of the Indian subcontinent. People shouted “Quit India” to the British, aligning with the aggressive Do or Die call of Mahatma Gandhi, despite the non-violent advocacy throughout his political career. Following his famous Quit India speech on 8th August 1942 at Gowalia Tank Maidan in Mumbai City, Mahatma Gandhi was arrested along with the entire national leadership of the Indian National Congress. Just as in his courageous act during the civil disobedience movement of 1930, Yusuf Meherally took charge of the campaign in the city in the absence of its leaders. Together with other young socialist leaders like Aruna Asaf Ali, Ram Manohar Lohia, and Achyut Patwardhan, he mobilized the people while hiding underground. However, he was soon arrested and imprisoned. During his prison tenure, Yusuf suffered a heart attack, and the prison administration offered to take him to St George Hospital. He demanded the administration take two other suffering freedom fighters to prison as well. As the authorities refused to comply, he chose to remain in prison, in solidarity with his comrades, till he was released with a weak physical body but an unwavering nationalist spirit.

Although bedridden, Yusuf Meherally contributed to the freedom struggle, which finally achieved its glory on 15th August 1947, when India gained independence. He was elected as a Member of the Bombay Legislative Assembly in 1946 and remained in the socio-cultural sphere of Bombay. Organizing exhibitions, literary gatherings, and cultural events in the city, he filled the atmosphere of Bombay Kala Ghoda with such imminent personalities’ presence and their intellectual conversation. The exhibition he launched in October 1949, highlighted the history of the Indian freedom struggle since 1857 with unique paintings and photographs. Though this courageous young man struggled against the British empire despite being imprisoned eight times throughout his life, Yusuf Meherally gave up his struggle for life with the world on 2nd July, 1950 at the age of 47. The entire Mumbai City remained shut mourning the loss of their brave leader and his significant contributions. Commemorating and disseminating his contributions in various parts of India, Yusuf Meherally Centre keeps the legacy of its leader still alive.
