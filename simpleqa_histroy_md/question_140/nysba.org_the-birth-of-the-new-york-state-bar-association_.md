## The Birth of the New York State Bar Association

4.13.2022

By Henry M. Greenberg

1876 was an eventful year. The Centennial of American Independence was celebrated. Alexander Graham Bell patented the telephone and the Brooklyn Bridge was under construction. Mark Twain’s inventor, Samuel L. Clemens, published “The Adventures of Tom Sawyer.” And the Battle of Little Big Horn, where George Armstrong Custer made his “Last Stand,” was fought in the Montana territory.[1]

1876 was a historic year for the legal profession, too. On a late November afternoon, the New York State Bar Association was born. Bar associations existed before then, but most served mainly social purposes.[2] While lawyers had previously joined together on a statewide basis, those efforts did not produce durable organizations.[3] The Association was the nation’s first state bar capable of legislative advocacy, developing public policy proposals and continuing legal education. It remains the oldest and largest voluntary state bar association in continuous existence.

**The Call for a Statewide Bar Association**

The apparent impetus for the Association’s formation was a story appearing in the Albany Law Journal, which had the largest circulation of any legal periodical of its time.[4] On the front page of the June 26, 1875 issue, the Journal called for the establishment of a state bar in New York.[5] In 1870, when the Association of the Bar of the City of New York was formed,[6] the prospect existed that, through its efforts, other local bar associations, and ultimately a state bar, would be organized.[7] But the City Bar had not taken the initiative. The Journal’s editor, Isaac Grant Thompson, believed that lawyers of the state should be “combined in an organic whole,”[8] which, as a collective force, could “do much in directing legislation on matters of jurisprudence, in improving the law and in advancing the best interests of the profession.”[9]

Elliott Fitch Shepard answered the Journal’s call to action.[10] Shepard was a public-spirited lawyer and pillar of the community in New York City.[11] Mildly eccentric and immensely wealthy, he represented the New York Central Railroad and several other large corporations but devoted his later years to editing a newspaper he owned, the Mail and Express. He was tall and dignified, with a pleasant expression and manner, and addressed as “Colonel,” the rank to which he rose in the Union Army during the Civil War.[12] No single person founded the Association. But no one did more than Shepard to make it happen.[13]

On Oct. 12, 1875, Shepard introduced a resolution at a City Bar meeting to appoint a committee “to investigate and report upon the feasibility and desirability of taking initiatory steps toward organizing an Association of the Bar of the State of New York.”[14] The City Bar adopted the resolution, and Shepard was appointed chair of a five-person committee.[15]

Shepard and his colleagues leapt to action.[16] First, the committee surveyed lawyers throughout the state on their views about creating a state bar. A letter containing 16 questions was sent to 1,300 lawyers, approximately one-half of whom practiced outside New York County. There were then an estimated 6,000 to 7,000 lawyers in the state (approximately the same number of physicians).[17]

The committee’s first question was: “Do you favor generally the formation of a State Bar Association?” The response – 306 to 4 in favor – was a nearly unanimous vote of approval. In response to another question, 239 lawyers named Albany as the proper place for permanent headquarters, and 21 named New York City. A variety of answers were given to questions about admission fees, dues and meetings. The question generating the sharpest difference of opinion was whether members should be selected by local bar associations or whether all members of the profession should be able to join irrespective of their connection to a local bar. Sixty-four answered that local bars should select members, while 187 indicated that lawyers should be eligible even if local bars did not choose them. Finally, 253 lawyers said they would join a state bar if one were formed.[18]

In December 1875, the Shepard Committee issued a report recommending that the City Bar “take initiatory steps toward the formation of a State Association.”[19] The report cited the example of England’s Inner and Middle Temple, and Lincoln’s and Grey’s Inns, as voluntary organizations that contributed to “the high character of the English Bar.”[20] The committee did not opine on how members should be selected, leaving that question to the future organization to settle when constituted.[21] It did, however, maintain that a state bar would result in the improvement and elevation of lawyers, by giving them an opportunity to “be heard on the higher topics of the rights of persons, the administration of government, the security of property, the philosophy of jurisprudence, the history of the law, the suggestions of progress, the victories of reform.”[22]

To organize and establish a state bar, the committee recommended holding a “convention”[23] composed of delegates from New York’s eight judicial districts (as then constituted).[24] The proposed plan was for the City Bar to invite each judicial district to select 20 delegates and 20 alternates for the convention. About 100 lawyers were expected to attend the convention, giving it a representative character.[25]

The Assembly chamber of the old state Capitol, where 91 delegates met on Nov. 21, 1876 to form the New York State Bar Association. 

On the evening of Dec. 14, the Shepard Committee report was presented at a meeting of the City Bar held at its headquarters on 7 West 29th St.[26] Many prominent members attended the meeting, chaired by the City Bar’s president, William M. Evarts, a former U.S. attorney general and future U.S. secretary of state and U.S. senator.[27] The members voted to adopt the committee’s report, but tabled a resolution implementing its recommendations until the City Bar’s next meeting.[28] That occurred on April 11, 1876, when Shepard moved for adoption of the resolution. The motion carried and Shepard’s Committee was tasked with organizing the convention.[29]

As word spread about the convention, so too did support for establishing a state bar.[30] The New York Times reported that “[t]he project for the formation of the State Association seem[ed] to have taken deep root among the members of the legal profession,”[31] and had “the endorsement of all the leading Judges and lawyers of the State.”[32] In March 1876, the Times inked an editorial arguing that a state bar was necessary to remedy “many irregularities and evils” that “can never be amended except by a unified effort among the better members of the profession.” A state bar could, for example, “rais[e] the standard of admission to the profession” and to stem the “flooding” of “half prepared young lawyers . . . which has prevailed for the last few years,” the Times observed.[33]

**Organizing the Convention**

The Shepard Committee set to work organizing the convention. In addition to inviting judicial districts to appoint their representatives, the committee had to choose a place and time for the convention, prepare an agenda, recruit leaders, devise a committee structure and draft foundational documents.[34]

The judicial districts promptly responded to their invitations. On May 30, lawyers in the 3rd Judicial District convened in Albany to select delegates and alternates.[35] Over the summer, meetings were held by the 1st Judicial District in New York City,[36] the 2nd Judicial District in Brooklyn[37] and the 5th Judicial District in Syracuse.[38] The other judicial districts did likewise.

The convention was scheduled for Nov. 21 in Albany, in the old state Capitol. Designed by noted architect Philip Hooker and completed in 1809 with a three-story portico, it was an impressive venue.[39]

As the convention drew near, America was in turmoil over the presidential election on Nov. 7 between New York Governor Samuel J. Tilden and Ohio Governor Rutherford B. Hayes.[40] Tilden won the popular vote by a decisive margin. But Hayes’ allies challenged the returns in four states that would determine the majority vote of the electoral college. Congress appointed an electoral commission which, by a single vote, gave the election to Hayes. The final electoral college tally of 185 to 184 came only a few days before Hayes’ scheduled inaugural in 1877.[41]

Ninety-one delegates assembled in the Assembly Chamber of the venerable old Capitol on Nov. 21, 1876.[42] “[S]eldom,” it was remarked, “had there gathered together so many leading members of the Bench and Bar.”[43] The delegates came from every region.[44] The Times described them as representing, “in an unusual degree, the learning and culture of the Bar of the State.”[45]

Shepard called the meeting to order at 3:30 p.m. and moved that William C. Ruger from Syracuse serve as temporary chairman.[46] Ruger was the first president of the Onondaga County Bar Association (founded the year before) and “one of the strongest and best equipped lawyers” in the state.[47] In 1882, he became the Association’s fourth president, and was elected later that year to chief judge of the Court of Appeals.[48] One newspaper endorsement of his candidacy posed the rhetorical question: “Thus standing the recognized head of the bar of the State of New York, who is more fit to sit at the head of the highest court of the state?”[49]

Upon taking the chair, Ruger briefly addressed the convention, and the roll of delegates and alternates was called.[50] Someone suggested a committee be appointed to propose a resolution forming the Association. But that was unnecessary; the delegates were ready to vote. Thus, a motion was made and carried that it was “expedient . . . a State Bar Association be now formed.”[51] Eight delegates, representing each of the judicial districts, were then selected as vice presidents of the convention, along with three secretaries.[52]

Clifford A. Hand, a founding member of the City Bar,[53] moved that a committee be formed to draft a constitution and bylaws.[54] Debate ensued as to the size of the committee, with some wanting every county in the state represented.[55] Horatio Ballard, a prominent Cortland County lawyer and former New York secretary of state, strongly supported Hand’s motion, which was approved, and a 16-person committee formed, composed of two delegates from each judicial district.[56] The delegates discussed the manner of conducting further business and, without coming to closure, the convention adjourned until the evening.[57]

The convention reconvened at 7:30 p.m., with a larger attendance than in the afternoon.[58] Shepard, on behalf of the Committee on Constitution and Bylaws, reported a draft constitution, which was read out loud by Rockland County Judge Andrew E. Suffern.[59] The delegates went through the draft article by article and, after amending 12 of 22 articles, adopted it.[60]

The constitution provided that any lawyer in good standing, admitted to practice in the state for three years, was eligible for membership.[61] All Court of Appeals and federal judges in New York, as well as state Supreme Court justices, would be honorary members.[62] Annual elections would be held for president, treasurer, recording secretary, corresponding secretary and vice presidents from each judicial district.[63] The Association would be managed by an Executive Committee consisting of three members from each judicial district.[64] Five standing committees were established: Admissions, Grievances, Law Reform, Prizes, and Legal Biography.[65] An annual meeting would be held in Albany on the third Tuesday of November,[66] and an admission fee of $5 was established, with yearly dues of $5.[67] (dues remained at that level until 1928, when they rose to $6.[68]).

The Nominating Committee proposed the following slate of officers:

  * President, John K. Porter
  * Treasurer, Rufus W. Peckham
  * Recording Secretary, Abraham Van Dyck De Witt
  * Corresponding Secretary, Edward Mitchell
  * Vice President, First District, Charles W. Sandford
  * Vice President, Second District, John J. Armstrong
  * Vice President, Third District, Samuel Hand
  * Vice President, Fourth District, Platt Potter
  * Vice President, Fifth District, William C. Ruger
  * Vice President, Sixth District, Horatio Ballard
  * Vice President, Seventh District, James L. Angle
  * Vice President, Eighth District, Myron H. Peck[69]



This was a legal dream team in 1876. As for the officers, Porter was “one of the greatest American advocates”[70] and a former judge of the Court of Appeals.[71] He was involved in many of the famous cases of the day, including the prosecution of Charles J. Guiteau, who assassinated President James J. Garfield in 1881.[72] The Albany Law Journal observed that Porter “comes nearer to being a genius than any other man at our bar.”[73] Peckham, the son of a deceased Court of Appeals judge, later held a seat on that court as well as the U.S. Supreme Court.[74] De Witt was a prominent lawyer and civic leader in Albany.[75] Mitchell, the treasurer of the City Bar, “was a leading lawyer of his time,”[76] later serving as an assemblyman, New York City parks commissioner and U.S. attorney for the Southern District of New York.[77]

The pedigrees of the vice presidents were equally dazzling. Samuel Hand (the father of Learned Hand, a legendary jurist of the 20th century) was a former judge of the Court of Appeals,[78] and Ruger a future chief judge.[79] Sandford was a Civil War Union general;[80] Angle, a Supreme Court justice from Rochester;[81] Armstrong, a Queens County judge;[82] Ballard, a former statewide elected official, assemblyman and district attorney;[83] Potter, an ex officio judge of the Court of Appeals,[84] Supreme Court justice and legal scholar;[85] and Peck, one of the ablest attorneys in Genesee County.[86]

The convention elected the officers’ slate, in addition to an Executive Committee and the chairs and members of the other standing committees.[87] Shepard chaired the Committee on Prizes; the other chairs were Peter S. Danforth, a Supreme Court justice from Schoharie County (Admissions);[88] John F. Seymour, a prominent lawyer from Utica whose brother, Horatio, was a former New York governor (Grievances);[89] Matthew Hale, one of Albany’s “foremost lawyers” (Law Reform);[90] and Abraham X. Parker, a former member of the state Assembly and Senate and future congressman (Legal Biography).[91]

The convention had done everything necessary to form the Association. Ruger, as convention president, retired, and the convention permanently adjourned so that the newly formed Association could assemble with President Porter in the chair. Porter immediately convened the Association’s first meeting, with the officers taking their seats.[92]

Greeted with applause, the 58-year-old Porter, bespectacled and mustachioed with a theatrical speaking style,[93] delivered a “particularly happy” address.[94] He thanked the members for their expression of confidence and said that the honor of serving as president was beyond anything that could be bestowed by executive favor or the suffrage of the people. He paid tribute to the nation’s lawyers and predicted a useful future for the Association.[95]

A few remaining issues were addressed. The Executive Committee was directed to take the necessary steps to incorporate the Association.[96] An offer by the Albany Law Journal to act as the Association’s official publication was referred to the Executive Committee.[97] Shepard proposed an annual writing prize on behalf of 25 lawyers from the 1st Judicial District.[98] That offer was accepted, making it the first action taken by the Association apart from matters of formal organization.

The meeting concluded just before 1 a.m.[99] The delegates had “laid down an historic record.”[100]

There being no rest for the weary, the Executive Committee, with Porter as its chair, convened later that morning at Congress Hall Hotel, adjacent to the old Capitol. The Executive Committee appointed a subcommittee to draft rules and regulations, fixed the quorum requirement for its future meetings, adopted the Association’s bylaws, and appointed the Albany Law Journal the official publication of the Association.[101] A subcommittee was appointed to draft and lobby for legislation incorporating the Association.[102]

**The First Year**

The Association’s first year was devoted to organizational matters, with the Executive Committee doing most of the work.[103] In 1877, the Executive Committee met in person five times[104] and transacted most business by correspondence.[105] At its Jan. 13, 1877 meeting, the Executive Committee adopted rules and regulations for itself,[106] amended the bylaws[107] and authorized Porter to designate people to call the first meetings of standing committees.[108] It also selected a new chair for the Grievance Committee, Hamilton Fish Jr. (a future speaker of the state Assembly and congressman), and appointed Chauncey M. Depew (general counsel for the New York Central Railroad and a future U.S. senator) to the Committee on Prizes.[109]

On May 2, the Legislature passed Chapter 210 of the Laws of 1877, entitled “An Act to Incorporate the New York State Bar Association.”[110] It transformed the voluntary Association established at the convention into a body corporate. Section 1 recited that the Association was “formed to cultivate the science of jurisprudence, to promote reform in the law, to facilitate the administration of justice, to elevate the standard of integrity, honor and courtesy in the profession, and to cherish the spirit of brotherhood among the members thereof.”[111]

The act’s reference to “brotherhood” was drawn from the Association’s constitution[112] and reflected the reality that the law was an all-male profession. Women were then barred from practicing law in New York. In 1886, Governor David B. Hill (who, at the time, was also the Association’s president)[113] signed legislation removing restrictions on the admission of women.[114] But it took the Association another 15 years to admit its first woman member and a century to elect a woman president.[115]

The Executive Committee’s July 18 meeting was especially productive. Members convened at the United States Hotel in Saratoga Springs (then the most luxurious resort town in the U.S.) and worked through an agenda dominated by proposals from Shepard.[116] The chairs of the Committees on Admissions and Prizes delivered reports.[117] Also, planning began for the upcoming “annual meeting,”[118] at which substantive reports would be delivered by the Grievance Committee on the unauthorized practice of law,[119] and the Committee on Law Reform on a Code of Civil Procedure being considered by the Legislature.[120]

Like any fledging membership organization, the Association sought to attract dues-paying members.[121] At first, the results were disappointing. On Dec. 15, 1876, Treasurer Peckham mailed a letter to 160 officers and committee members appointed at the convention, advising that they could accept membership simply by paying the “$5 admission fee now, and the $5 annual dues for 1877, any time before May 1st, 1877.”[122] But only 20 people responded in the first few months.[123] By April 1877, the situation was not much improved.[124]

One obstacle was the labyrinthine process for electing members prescribed by the bylaws as well as regulations established by a 32-member Committee on Admissions.[125] To become a member, a lawyer needed to be “admitted” as if to a private club.[126] A candidate had to be nominated by at least one member residing in the same judicial district as the candidate. A committee of members in that district would examine the candidate’s credentials. Only if the district committee unanimously approved the candidate could his name be forwarded to the Executive Committee for approval.[127]

This process perplexed many[128] and was criticized by the Albany Law Journal, which argued that “[e]very member of the bar in good standing should be entitled to admission.”[129] In a stinging editorial, the Journal wrote: “We have read the bylaws of the Association several times over and have dwelt with peculiar interest upon that relating to admission, and yet we are no more able to tell, off-hand, how to get into the Association than Ali Baba was to tell how to get out of the robbers’ cave.”[130]

To streamline the admissions process, the Executive Committee eliminated an “obstructive regulation”[131] and mailed to over 1,000 “members elect” a “Blue Book” containing a list of their names as well as the proceedings of the organizing convention, and the texts of the constitution, bylaws, and Executive Committee rules and regulations.[132] Accompanying the Blue Book was a letter informing recipients of their election to the Association and a document to be completed and returned that would secure placement on the Roll of Members.[133]

These efforts bore fruit. In the fall, there was a surge of new members.[134] By November, 356 members paid the $5 admission fee, with many also paying their annual $5 dues.[135] The Association “began its work with a large and distinguished charter membership.”[136]

**The First Annual Meeting**

The Association’s first Annual Meeting took place on the afternoon of Nov. 20, 1877, once again in the Assembly Chamber of the old Capitol.[137] It was the largest meeting of New York lawyers ever held.[138]

Following an invocation, President Porter delivered an address on the Association’s common purposes and aims.[139] A person who heard it reminisced 20 years later: “No one who was present when President Porter first called the Association to order will forget the thrill awakened by his address.”[140]

Repeatedly interrupted by applause, Porter said the Association was designed for “noble ends” – to be “of practical benefit” to the profession and public.[141] He challenged the members to rise to the occasion:

“Do we, in our day and generation, owe any duty to the profession and to the state? . . . Is it not our duty to add to the effective forces of the state in all the agencies of human progress and improvement? Is it not in our power to exercise a healthful influence upon each other? . . . The influence of our profession in the next generation depends on a large degree on the manner in which we fulfill our duty.”[142]

Porter believed that lawyers could only meet the challenges facing the profession by working together:

“We are strengthened by association with each other. The standard of professional integrity and honor is elevated by mutual intercourse, and by the consciousness that our own status is determined by the enlightened judgment of our brethren. The weight of the profession in the community and its influence upon public affairs are greatly increased when it is known that the ends that they aim to promote are not those of personal ambition, or individual rivalry, but such as are identified with the general good, the advancement of the highest interest of society, the perfecting of our system of jurisprudence, the maintenance of public order and the stability of private rights.”[143]

Porter stressed that the Association’s obligation to the profession and public “reached far beyond the present generation.” He envisioned a day when future generations would remember the founders of “an institution identified with the development of jurisprudence and with the permanent interests and prosperity of the state.”[144] “Let us trust,” he said, “that this Association may endure, and that it may exercise a collective and permanent influence.”[145]

After Porter’s address, the meeting turned to the election of new honorary members. Motions were unanimously approved to elect the chief justice and associate justices of the U.S. Supreme Court, other judges, and the vice president of the United States, William A. Wheeler, a New York lawyer. Perhaps still smarting over New York Governor Tilden’s defeat the year before, a motion to elect President Hayes, members of his cabinet and others was referred to the Committee on Admissions.[146]

Treasurer Peckham reported that the Association’s receipts totaled $3,355.70, and disbursements were $1,500, leaving a balance of $1,855.70.[147] Chairs of the standing committees delivered reports,[148] and papers were read on domestic relations law[149] and proposed changes in probate procedure.[150]

Loud applause greeted the appearance of the chief judge of the Court of Appeals, Sanford E. Church.[151] His assignment was to present the Post-Graduate Prize to Walter R. Howe, the 27-year-old author of the winning essay, “The Legal Relations of Capital and Labor.” This was a controversial subject selected for contestants by the Committee on Prizes.[152]

It was the Gilded Age: an era of rapid economic expansion, accompanied by labor strife, income disparity and political agitation.[153] Shepard, the committee’s chair, was “one of the major conservatives of his day.”[154] He opposed strikes, believing that the modern corporation was “one of the greatest blessings of the nineteenth century, and a distinguishing mark of its civilization.”[155] In his committee report, he said that “if the result of the presentation of this topic should be a calm, learned, comprehensive and judicious treatise, recalling the attention of the people to the legal principles which underlie and regulate the contract between the employer and the employed, the Association would have done a notable good to the whole community.”[156] But not everyone agreed. In editorials published before the Annual Meeting, the Albany Law Journal decried the committee’s chosen subject as “not such a one as a purely legal association would care about having discussed,”[157] and hoped that “subjects more completely legal in their nature than the present one, may be designated hereafter.”[158]

Before presenting the prize – a generous $250 – Chief Judge Church made a brief address. A man of “commanding stature, robust physique, and distinguished presence,”[159] he expressed gratification with the Association’s formation and confidence it would meet with public favor. He said the Association would “tend to produce cordiality of feeling among the members, and between the profession and the bench,” and “repress evil practices and elevate the standard of education and conduct.” Then, channeling the criticism of the Committee on Prizes, Church offered the following “caution” in the Association’s management:

“That it confine itself strictly to its legitimate object of reforming abuses, and elevating the professional standard, and refrain from interfering with matters foreign to them. If it will do this, it will be eminently successful; if not, dissension will be engendered, and it will likely fail.”

The members broke out in applause.[160]

Shepard made a proposal that the Association’s corporate seal bear an image of Chancellor James Kent’s head and the motto “Deus Optimus Maximus Legislator Solus,” Latin for “God, Utmost and Greatest, the Sole Legislator.”[161] The proposal was referred to the Executive Committee, which, several months later, opted instead for a seal with two concentric circles, inserting between the inner and outer circles the words “New York State Bar Association” at the top and “1876” at the bottom. In the center was a scroll bearing the Latin word “Justicia,” meaning Justice.[162] The seal doubled as the Association’s logo, which remained in use through 1969.

Delighted over the Annual Meeting’s success,[163] prominent lawyers, politicians and Supreme Court justices from around the state feasted on a sumptuous meal. The head waiter remarked to a reporter: “It is not often so large a company of prominent judges and lawyers gather at dinner as are here now.”[164]

The host of worthies that established the Association built better than they knew. In just two years, the Association was poised to move from strength to strength. As the Executive Committee reported at the Annual Meeting: “The machinery is in thorough working order; and if the leading members of the profession in the state will direct its energies, much may be accomplished.”[165]

In the years that followed, Porter’s vision was realized. The Association has endured and had a collective and permanent influence. The delegates who assembled in the old state Capitol in 1876 would be amazed by the Association’s current technological capacity and programming; impressed by its efforts to do the public good; and inspired by the spirit of collegiality among the members. Indeed, for 145 years the Association has protected the citizenry’s rights and shaped the development of the law, by serving as a resource for all three branches of government.

The founders justly hold a place of honor in the Association’s long and rich history. Their example is one that the present generation may refer to with pride and gratitude.

The Journal explained that the Association would work to make the business of law lucrative and ensure unethical lawyers were punished and the unauthorized practice of law stopped.
