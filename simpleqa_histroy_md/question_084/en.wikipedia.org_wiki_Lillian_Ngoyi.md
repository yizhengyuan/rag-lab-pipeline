**Lilian Masediba Matabane Ngoyi** , "**Ma Ngoyi** ", OMSG (25 September 1911 – 13 March 1980) was a South African anti-apartheid activist.[1][2][3][4] She was the first woman elected to the executive committee of the African National Congress, and helped launch the Federation of South African Women. 

Prior to becoming a machinist at a textile mill, where she was employed from 1945 to 1956, Ngoyi enrolled to become a nurse.[5] In 1962, she was given her first banning order and would not be permitted to leave her house in Orlando, Soweto for the rest of her life, except for a three year period from 1972-1975. 

## Early life

[edit]

Ngoyi was born in Bleared Street, Pretoria.[6] She was the only daughter of Annie and Isaac Matabane, and three brothers, Lawrence, George and Percy. Her grandfather, on her mother's side, was Johannes Mphahlele, a member of the royal Mphahlele household, who became a Methodist evangelist, working alongside Samuel Mathabathe. Ngoyi's mother worked as a washerwoman and her father was a mineworker.[7][8] Ngoyi attended Kilnerton Primary School[7] until Standard Two. 

In 1928, she moved to Johannesburg to train as a nurse at City Deep Mine Hospital, and completed three years of training in general nursing.[9] During this time, she met and married a van driver, John Gerard Ngoyi, in 1934.[6] They had a daughter, Edith Ngoyi.[9] Lilian's husband died in a motor car accident in 1937, after which she became a seamstress, working both from home and in garment factories at various times.[9] From the 1950s onwards, she lived in Orlando, Soweto, with her mother and her children.[9]

## Political activism

[edit]

Having been drawn into politics via her work in the Garment Workers' Union of South Africa in the 1940s,[9] Ngoyi first joined the African National Congress (ANC) as an associate member during the 1950 Defiance Campaign, and would be arrested for using post office facilities reserved for white people.[10] Ngoyi would train in the non-violent protest strategies of _Satyagraha_ to resist the Urban Area's Act, and the expanded pass system of the Natives Act.[4] Ngoyi joined the ANC Women's League in 1952; she was at that stage a widow with children and an elderly mother to support, and worked as a seamstress.[9] A year later she was elected as President of the Women's League. In 1954, she helped to found the Federation of South African Women (FEDSAW) and was elected to the national executive of the ANC; she was the first woman to be elected to national office in the organisation.[9]

On 9 August 1956, Ngoyi led a women's march along with Helen Joseph, Rahima Moosa, Sophia De Bruyn, Motlalepula Chabaku, Bertha Gxowa and Albertina Sisulu of 20,000 women to the Union Buildings of Pretoria in protest against the apartheid government requiring women to carry passbooks as part of the pass laws. Ngoyi would command the crowd to be in complete silence for 30 minutes. This march remains the largest women's demonstration in the history of South Africa.[4]

Lilian Ngoyi was also a transnational figure who recognised the potential influence that international support could have on the struggle against apartheid and the emancipation of black women. With this in mind she had, in 1955, embarked on an illegal journey to Lausanne, Switzerland, in order to participate in the World Congress of Mothers held by the Women's International Democratic Federation (WIDF). Accompanied by her fellow activist Dora Tamana, and as an official delegate of FEDSAW, she embarked on a journey that would see an attempt to stow away on a boat leaving Cape Town under "white names",[7] defy (with the help of a sympathetic pilot) segregated seating on a plane bound for London and gain entry to Britain under the pretext of completing her course in Bible studies. She would visit England, Germany, Switzerland, Romania, China and Russia, meeting women leaders often engaged in left-wing politics, before arriving back in South Africa a wanted woman.[11]

Ngoyi would periodically lead ANC rallies against passes and on larger protests of issues in Pretoria. Ngoyi would continue to unite women, leading the third FSW conference in 1961, telling the women that "Freedom does not come walking towards you - it must be won. As women we must go on playing our part."[4]

Ngoyi was known as a strong orator and a fiery inspiration to many of her colleagues in the ANC. She was among the 156 Treason Trialists arrested in December 1956,[7][9][12] and was finally acquitted of the charges against her in 1960. She was rearrested more than once in the early 1960s, and spent 71 days in solitary confinement in 1963.[12] Ngoyi spent a total of 15 years living under three five-year banning orders,[12] which included restrictions that confined her to her home in Orlando, Soweto, and prevented her from meeting any other banned persons.[12] Additional conditions of the banning orders included being forbidden to attend public gatherings, make speeches or be quoted; even at her own home, she was not permitted to be with more than one person at the same time.[9] The first two banning orders were imposed in 1962 and 1967, and when the second banning order expired in 1972, she was able to meet colleagues and friends again, and travelled to Durban and Cape Town.[9] She would travel to Robben Island to visit ANC contemporary Nelson Mandela in prison, where Mandela would commend her leadership in various organisations.[13] In 1975, a banning order against her was imposed again; however, this time its conditions did allow her some communication with the outside world.[9] In the last decade of Nyogi's life, she would have to depend on gifts from friends and contemporaries to survive.[14]

## Memorials and honours
