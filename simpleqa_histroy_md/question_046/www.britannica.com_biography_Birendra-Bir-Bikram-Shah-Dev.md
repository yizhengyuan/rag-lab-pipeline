**Birendra Bir Bikram Shah Dev** (born December 28, 1945, Kathmandu, Nepal—died June 1, 2001, Kathmandu) was the king of Nepal from 1972 to 2001, 10th in the line of monarchs in the Shah Dev family.

Son of the crown prince (later, from 1955, king) Mahendra, Birendra was educated at St. Joseph’s College (Darjeeling, India), Eton College (England), Tokyo University (1967), and Harvard University (1967–68) and traveled extensively before acceding to the throne on his father’s death on January 31, 1972. (He was crowned on February 24, 1975.) Birendra continued the autocratic tradition of his father, who had dissolved the elected parliament in 1960 and banned political parties in the constitution of 1962; indeed, for a time, Birendra was one of the world’s few remaining absolute monarchs. He managed to maintain Nepal’s independence despite encroaching influences by India, China, and the Soviet Union. During his reign Nepal was opened up to extensive tourism.

Beginning early in 1990, a popular prodemocracy movement led to demonstrations that erupted into bloody clashes between the soldiers and police and the demonstrators. Submitting to pressure, Birendra lifted the ban on political activity and on November 9, 1990, approved a new constitution that preserved his status as chief of state but confirmed multiparty democracy, a separation of powers, and the protection of human rights.

On June 1, 2001, Birendra was fatally shot by his son Crown Prince Dipendra during a dinner party. Also killed were Queen Aiswarya, Prince Nirajan, Princess Shruti, and five other members of the royal family. After the attack, Dipendra turned the gun on himself and died three days later. It was believed that he acted under the influence of drugs and alcohol and was despondent because his parents disapproved of his choice of a bride. Birendra was succeeded by his brother, Gyanendra.
