Sustainability performance of food supply chains with internal and external evaluation perspectives

(OXFORD UNIV PRESS, GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND, 2024) Gürül, Binnur; Yılmaz, Dilek; Büyüksaatçı Kiriş, Sinem

The challenges of food security, water use, energy consumption and the growing global demand for food raise the importance of ensuring sustainability of the food supply chains (FSCs). Studies in relevant literature discuss the sustainability performances of FSCs generally without distinguishing between the internal and external stakeholders’ concerns or clarifying the existence of greenwashing or bluewashing attempts, jeopardizing true sustainability. This is why modelling towards some holistic treatment of the problem that satisfies those concerns is required. This paper proposes a framework to evaluate the true sustainability performance of FSCs by considering triple bottom line indicators, i.e. economic, environmental and social. In light of the proposed framework, two models have been developed, one calculating the internal and the other an external sustainability score. The presented models can handle interval or ordinal qualitative and quantitative indicators concurrently while considering desirable and undesirable factors. These novel models have been implemented on data from 50 FSCs in Istanbul, using a two-stage imprecise data envelopment analysis with a special multiplier. To facilitate visualization of true sustainability assessment, an internal–external sustainability performance matrix is proposed. Results reveal that the internal sustainability performance of the focal FSCs is better than the external one. The economic dimension predominates in Turkish FSCs’ internal sustainability performance, while the environmental and social dimensions predominate in the external sustainability performance of the FSCs.

Shock persistency to material consumption, renewable and non-renewable energy resources? A (non)linear evidence from the highest carbon emitting countries

(PERGAMON-ELSEVIER SCIENCE LTD, THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, ENGLAND, 2024) Çelik, Ali; Alola, Andrew Adewale

With the need to provide more evidence on the possibility of reducing material resources utilization and dependency i.e., improving material resources efficiency, this study considers 10 countries with the largest cumulative emissions over centuries (Brazil, Canada, China, France, Germany, India, Indonesia, Japan, the UK, and the USA) by employing the linear and non-linear unit root tests with the Fourier function and dataset that covers centuries (1850–2021). Specifically, domestic material consumption was implemented for the period 1970-2019, and 1965-2021 for renewable and non-renewable energy resources. Given the linearity and non-linearity evidence, the investigation reveals whether there is persistent or transitory shock in domestic material consumption, renewable energy (REC), and non-renewable energy sources (REC). For (linearity) unit root test evidence, there are transitory shocks in domestic material consumption only in China, France, Indonesia, and Japan, for China, France, India, Japan, England, and the USA in REC, and in all the countries except Brazil, Canada, Germany, and Indonesia for the NREC series. On the ground of (non-linearity) unit root test, the result reveals that shocks to non-renewable energy consumption are temporary only for Canada, Japan, and the USA and the shocks to renewable energy and domestic material consumptions are permanent in all the examined countries. Indeed, the outcome of these findings offers important knowledge to decision makers on how to carefully develop and implement transitory and persistence policy choices.

A Comprehensive Evaluation Model for Sustainable Supply Chain Capabilities in the Energy Sector

(MDPI, ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND, 2024) Safaei, Mehdi; Yahya, Khalid; Al Dawsari, Saleh

 __Daha fazla

This study introduces a comprehensive model to evaluate multiple capabilities within the sustainable supply chain evaluation framework. The primary aim is to determine the significance of various capabilities in the context of sustainable supply chains. The research involved a sample of sixteen companies operating in Iran’s energy sector. The findings indicate that the majority of these companies are at level two in terms of capability. Therefore, it is recommended that these companies employ this model to assess their capability levels and identify any existing gaps. Methodologically, a checklist tool was used to refine the criteria using the fuzzy Delphi method. Subsequently, an appropriate model was chosen and developed by reviewing existing evaluation models. The criteria were compared and finalized using the Analytic Hierarchy Process. Finally, the criteria were further refined and validated through a fuzzy expert system, incorporating Adaptive Neuro-Fuzzy Inference System and Fuzzy Inference System. The developed model was then simulated and validated using MATLAB Simulink software (R2017b).

Comparative Efficacy of Quadratus Lumborum Muscle Energy Technique with Gluteus Medius Strengthening Versus Gluteus Medius Strengthening Alone in Sacroiliac Joint Dysfunction: A Randomized Controlled Trial

(MDPI, ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND, 2024) Soomro, Rabail Rani; Karimi, Hossein; Gilani, Syed Amir

 __Daha fazla

Background: Pain in the sacroiliac joint is the most prevalent and often overlooked. The sacroiliac joints are thought to be sources of pain in roughly 10% to 25% of patients with chronic lower back pain. Due to the biomechanical nature of the joint, muscle imbalance is the most important cause of sacroiliac joint dysfunction. The hamstring and gluteus medius are the primary muscles involved in postural dysfunction-related muscle imbalance; however, the quadratus lumborum’s role in the compensatory mechanism is becoming more apparent, and its potential for treatment in conjunction with gluteus medius strengthening has not yet been investigated. Gluteus medius exercises, along with conventional treatment, are routinely given to patients with sacroiliac joint dysfunction; however, the aim of this study is to explore the additional effects of the muscle energy technique (MET) on the quadratus lumborum along with strengthening of the gluteus medius on pain, disability and quality of life of patients with sacroiliac joint dysfunction. Methods: Using a computer-generated random number table, seventy patients with unilateral sacroiliac joint pain were divided equally and randomly into two groups. Prior to initiating treatment, baseline measurements were taken using a hand-held dynamometer, visual analog scale (VAS), Oswestry Disability Index (ODI-U) and short form 36-item survey (SF-36v2) to assess strength, pain, functional disability and quality of life, respectively. Over the course of four weeks, all patients received twelve sessions, and both the preand post-intervention outcome measures were documented. Results: After 4 weeks of treatment, both groups showed statistically significant (p < 0.005) mean improvements in muscle strength, pain, disability and quality of life before and after intervention. However, the mean improvements in post-intervention on a dynamometer, VAS, ODI and SF-36 were better in the MET with exercise group (METGME) as compared to the conventional group with exercise (CTGME), with a larger effect size. Conclusions: The muscle energy technique, applied to the quadratus lumborum in combination with gluteus medius strengthening, is more effective clinically and significantly in improving pain, disability and quality of life in comparison to conventional treatment of sacroiliac joints with gluteus medius exercises.

The Properties of Pectin Extracted from the Residues of Vinegar-Fermented Apple and Apple Pomace

(MDPI, ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND, 2024) Muslu Can, Aslı; Metin Yıldırım, Ruşen; Karadağ, Ayşe

In this study, both apple slices and apple pomace, the by-product of apple juice processing, were subjected to vinegar fermentation. The pectins extracted from the solid residue of vinegarfermented apple slices (FAP) and apple pomaces (FAPP) were compared to the pectin extracted from non-fermented apple pomace (AP). All samples were classified as high-methoxyl pectins, and vinegar fermentation increased pectin extraction yield. FAP, which has a lower degree of methylation, also exhibited lower thermal stability. The changes in the pectin structure were dependent on both fermentation and the state of the raw material used to produce the vinegar. Compared to AP, the proportion of homogalacturonans (HGs) increased, and the proportion of rhamnogalacturonan I (RG-I) decreased in FAP, providing higher linearity, whereas in FAPP, the RG-I region became more dominant with reduced linearity. The molecular weight distribution of samples showed that pectin from vinegar-fermented sources changed the average molecular weights and mass fraction ratios of two peaks (1255 and 340 kDa) eluted from AP. In FAP, the mass fraction of the first peak (1294 kDa) increased from 35 to 89%, whereas in FAPP, the mass fraction of the second peak (478 kDa) increased to 91%. FAPP showed greater viscosity and a more noticeable shear-thinning behavior. G′ and G′′ in FAPP were also higher than those of AP and FAP at the same concentrations (5%, 7%, and 10% w/v). This study found that applying vinegar fermentation to apple slices and apple pomaces altered the structural and rheological properties of the extracted pectins. FAP and FAPP could be suitable food additives when certain properties are required.
