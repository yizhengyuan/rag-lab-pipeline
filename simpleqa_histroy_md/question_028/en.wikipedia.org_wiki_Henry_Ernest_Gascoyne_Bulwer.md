Bulwer was appointed to the Order of St Michael and St George, as Companion in 1864, Knight Commander in 1874, and as Knight Grand Cross in 1883.[8]

## Commemoration

[edit]

The town of Bulwer in Natal, South Africa was named after him.[9]

While Governor of Labuan he presented the type specimen of Bulwer's pheasant (_Lophura bulweri_) to the British Museum, a bird consequently named after him.[10][3]

The author H. Rider Haggard, who had been on his staff in Natal and was his friend, dedicated the novel _Marie_ to Sir Henry Bulwer.[11]
