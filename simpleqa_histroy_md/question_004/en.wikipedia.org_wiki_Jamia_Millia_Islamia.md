Originally established at Aligarh, United Provinces (present-day Uttar Pradesh, India) during the British Raj in 1920, it moved to its current location in Okhla in 1935.[7] It was given the deemed status by the University Grants Commission in 1962. Jamia Millia Islamia became a central university by an act of the Indian parliament which was passed on 26 December 1988.[8]

The university was founded by Muhammad Iqbal, Mohammad Ali Jauhar,[9] Hakim Ajmal Khan, Mahmud Hasan Deobandi, Mukhtar Ahmed Ansari, Abdul Majeed Khwaja, Zakir Hussain, Mahatma Gandhi and Maulana Azad. Its foundation stone was laid by Mahmud Hasan Deobandi, the leader of Silk Letter Movement and the first student of Darul Uloom Deoband along with his fellow Mohammed Ali Jauhar, Hakim Ajmal Khan, Mukhtar Ahmad Ansari, and Abdul Majid Khwaja.[10][11]

## History

[edit]

A 1970 Indian stamp dedicated to the 50th anniversary of Jamia Millia Islamia

Jamia Millia Islamia was established in Aligarh on 29 October 1920 by nationalist leaders and students of Aligarh Muslim University.[16]

Maulana Mohammad Ali Jauhar, Hakim Ajmal Khan, Dr. Mukhtar Ahmad Ansari, and Abdul Majeed Khwaja were the founding members and it was established mainly in response to the demand of these fellows of the Aligarh Muslim University for a new National Muslim University which would be free from government influence as they felt that the administration of Aligarh Muslim University was of pro-British stance.[17][18][19]

### Foundation

[edit]

The founding members included Muhammad Ali Jauhar, Hakim Ajmal Khan and Mukhtar Ahmed Ansari. The foundation stone was laid by Mahmud Hasan Deobandi, an Islamic scholar and activist of the Indian independence movement. He was invited to preside over the foundational ceremony of the university in Aligarh. His speech was prepared and read aloud by his student Shabbir Ahmad Usmani.[17][20] Its subsequent makers included Abdul Majeed Khwaja, Abid Hussain, Mohammad Mujeeb and Zakir Hussain.[17][21]

The foundation committee of Jamia included Kifayatullah Dehlawi, Hussain Ahmad Madani, Syed Sulaiman Nadwi, Abdul Haq, Abdul Bari Firangi Mahali, Shabbir Ahmad Usmani, Sanaullah Amritsari, Muhammad Iqbal, Syed Mahmud, and Saifuddin Kitchlew.[22][23]

It was conceived as a national institution that would offer progressive education and an emphasis on Indian nationalism to students from all communities, particularly Muslims. Hussain described “the movement of Jamia Millia Islamia as a struggle for education and cultural renaissance that aims to prepare a blueprint for Indian Muslims which may focus on Islam but simultaneously evolve a national culture for common Indian.”[17] The emergence of Jamia was supported by Mahatma Gandhi,[24][25][26][27] who felt that Jamia Millia Islamia could shape lives of students on the basis of a shared culture and worldview, so Gandhi sent his youngest son Devdas Gandhi to teach Hindi in Jamia.[28]

In 1925, Jamia Millia Islamia moved from Aligarh to Karol Bagh, New Delhi.[21] On 1 March 1935, the foundation stone for a school building was laid at Okhla, then a nondescript village in the southern outskirts of Delhi. In 1936, all institutions of Jamia Millia Islamia except Jamia Press, the Maktaba, and the library moved to the new campus.[21][29]

The University Grants Commission gave Jamia Millia Islamia the deemed status in 1962. Subsequently, on 26 December 1988, it attained the status of a central university through an act of the Indian parliament. 

In 2006, King Abdullah of Saudi Arabia paid a visit to the university and donated ₹130 crore(US$30 million)[a] for the construction of a library and a research center.[30]
