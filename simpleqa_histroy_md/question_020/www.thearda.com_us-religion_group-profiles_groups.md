# General Association of General Baptists (1870 - Present) - Religious Group

**Religious Family:** Baptist  
**Religious Tradition:** Evangelical Protestant  
**Description:** The General Association of General Baptists dates back to the 1820s and the ministry of Benoni Stinson. After Stinson was baptized (1820) and ordained (1821) in Kentucky, he moved to Indiana and began his own church after the Wabash United Baptist Association would not tolerate his Arminian freewill views. This church grew, and soon other churches with Arminian perspectives were formed. In 1824, churches that followed Stinson's teachings organized as the Liberty Association of General Baptists, which then spread south and west. In 1870, the general association was formed.

#### Sources

1 Congregational adherents include all full members, their children, and others who regularly attend services. The adherence rate is the number of people per 1,000 who are an adherent of the group. For example an adherence rate of 600 means that 600 out of every 1,000 people in this area are adherents of the General Association of General Baptists.

The 2020 data were collected by the Association of Statisticians of American Religious Bodies (ASARB) and include data for 372 religious bodies or groups. Of these, the ASARB was able to gather data on congregations and adherents for 217 and on congregations only for 155. [More information on the data sources]

2 All data on clergy, members, and churches are taken from the National Council of Churches’ _Historic Archive CD_ and recent print editions of the Council’s _Yearbook of American and Canadian Churches_. The CD archives all 68 editions of the Yearbook (formerly called _Yearbook of the Churches_ and _Yearbook of American Churches_) from 1916 to 2000. Read more information on the _Historic Archive CD_ and the _Yearbook_.

Membership figures are "inclusive." According to the _Yearbook_ , this includes "those who are full communicant or confirmed members plus other members baptized, non-confirmed or non-communicant." Each denomination has its own criteria for membership. 

When a denomination listed on the _Historic Archive CD_ was difficult to identify, particularly in early editions of the Yearbook, the ARDA staff consulted numerous sources, including Melton’s _Encyclopedia of American Religions_ and the _Handbook of Denominations in the United States_. In some cases, ARDA staff consulted the denomination’s website or contacted its offices by phone. When a denomination could not be positively identified, its data were omitted.
