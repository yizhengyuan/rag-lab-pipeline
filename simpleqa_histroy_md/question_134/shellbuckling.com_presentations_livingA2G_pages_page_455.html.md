### Professor Narinder Kumar Gupta

Henry Ford Chair Emeritus Professor  
Department of Applied Mechanics  
Indian Institute of Technology, Delhi, India  
  
Biography:  
Born on 22 August 1942, Prof. N. K. Gupta works in the area of large deformations of metals and composites at low, medium and high rates of loading. His researches find application in development of constitutive behaviour of materials, understanding of the basic mechanics of large deformation, design for crashworthiness of road and air vehicles, design for safety in defence applications and in design of metal forming processes. He has published his researches extensively in national and international journals, guided researches at Ph.D. and M.Tech. levels, and undertaken national and international research and consultancy projects. He has been visiting Professor / fellow / invited to deliver guest lectures in universities in Armenia, Australia, Brazil, China, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, New Zealand, Malaysia, Norway, Poland, Russia, Singapore, South Africa, , Thailand, Turkey, UAE, UK, and USA. He has been serving on the Editorial Advisory Boards of International Journals of Mechanical Sciences, Int. J. of Impact Engineering, Int. J. of Crashworthiness, L. A. Int. J. of Solids and Structures, Thin Walled Structures, J. fatigue and fracture of Engg. Mat. And Str., Journal of Aeronautics Society of India, Proceedings of the Indian National Science Academy, Sadhna, and Everyman’s Science. He is President of the Indian Society of Industrial and Applied Mathematics, and past President of the Indian Society of Theoretical and Applied Mechanics and past President of the Indian Society of Mechanical Engineers. He was Vice President of the Indian National Science Academy and Chairman of the National Committee of the Academy for IUTAM and IMU. He is member of IUTAM Bureau and Congress Committee. He is member / chairman of several other national and international academic bodies. He is Fellow of Indian National Science Academy, Indian National Academy of Engineering, National Academy of Sciences, India, Aeronautical Society of India and Institution of Engineers   
  
He is recipient of J.C.Bose Memorial Award, O.P. Bhasin Award, Millenium Plaques of Honour (ISCA) Award, Erskine (New Zealand) award, Alexander von Humboldt (Germany) Research Award, and several other honours and awards. He has been conferred Doctor Honoris Causa by the Russian Academy of Sciences and Meractor Professorship of DFG.   
Prof. Gupta was conferred Padma Shri by the President of India in 1991.
