# Infanterikanonvagn 72 / 102 / 103

Infantry Cannon Carrier 72/102/103 (Ikv 72/102/103) was a family of diminuative armored vehicle developed by Landsverk. In early 1949, Swedish the army was looking to acquire a new generation of AFVs, including a new assault gun provide mechanized direct fire support for the infantry. It was intended that this vehicle would replace towed artillery, and so the new assault gun needed to be as cheap as possible, so numerous vehicles could be built. Thus it was decided to go with a very small, very lightweight design, no heavier than 6 tons and to use readily available parts wherever possible. The amazingly small size of this vehicle can only be appreciated in photographs with crew members providing scale. These vehicles look like their full size counterparts, but actually they are much smaller than normal.

Between 1952 and 1954 a total of 36 copies was delivered to the army. Its purpose was carriage with explosive shells supporting infantry brigades attack. Ikv 72 had an open top in the front of the cart, while the engine and the gearbox was positioned in the rear part. The drive took place at the rear wheels, which is unusual for Swedish armored vehicles. The carrying wheels were mounted on two wheels and two bars, which were suspended in pendulum arms.

The first prototype, armed with three 8mm machineguns, was finished in early 1950. This armament, little more than a portable machine-gun nest, was, however, found rather lacking and the prototype was soon refitted with a 75mm gun. The re-armed prototype weighed 6,5 tons and was powered by a 105hp Volvo engine, that gave the tiny vehicle a power to weight ratio of 17hp/t and an impressive top speed of 60kph. The low weight did not allow a lot of armor.

The gun sat stored directly in frontpansaret and sidriktfältet was therefore limited to 5° in each direction. Even when Ikv 72 projects were, it was clear that the canon caliber needed to be at least 10.5 cm, but where none such were available, they chose as a temporary solution, the same gun as the Tank m42. 

Between 1956 and 1958, the Infantry Cannon Wagon 102 (Ikv 102) was built. Tith the help of Bofors, the 10,5cm Haub m/40 howitzer was adapted for use on the Ikv 72. In 1956-58, all vehicles were rebuilt with a new roof and other improvements, as well as fitted with the gun. As such, the vehicle was re-designated Ikv 102. 

It mounted armored shutters that could cover the open battle space and changed the gun to a newly developed 105 mm piece from Bofors. It was actually considered as a howitzer and not a gun. It was initially used exclusively to fire explosive shells, but during the 1960s the first half was purchased even armor-explosive shells with directed explosive action to combat armored vehicles. 

In this configuration, the vehicle served until mid 70s, when it was replaced by the Ikv 91 in the early 1980s to about Pvrbbv 551.

Infantry Cannon Wagon 103 (Ikv 103) was a slightly improved version of Ikv 102. It received a four-cylinder boxer engine from the Swedish aircraft engine in Trollhattan. Ikv 103 built in the early 1980s, and assigned to Pvrbbv 551 and Lvrbbv 701. 

After the Ikv 103, it would be until the mid-60s before the Ikv concept was brought up again, but this time with an emphasis on being able to fight tanks and other AFVs. In total three different companies were asked to submit their designs for the new Ikv, which they called Ikv 65. First there was Landsverk, who had produced the other Ikvs. Then there was Hägglunds, who had just started producing their armoured personell carrier design for the Swedish army and finally there was Bofors, who was also developing the S-tank. 

Despite the Landsverk design being the one preferred by the Army, it was ultimately decided to go with the Hägglunds design due to the greater interchangeability of parts between the new Ikv and the Hägglunds-designed and built Pbv 302 APC. Eventually, this led to the production Ikv 91 in 1975.
