**Hironaka Heisuke** (born April 9, 1931, Yamaguchi prefecture, Japan) is a Japanese mathematician who was awarded the Fields Medal in 1970 for his work in algebraic geometry.

Hironaka graduated from Kyōto University (1954) and Harvard University, Cambridge, Massachusetts, U.S. (Ph.D., 1960); at the latter he studied under Oscar Zariski. Hironaka held an appointment at Columbia University, New York City, from 1964 to 1968, when he began teaching at Harvard. In 1975 he accepted a joint professorship at Kyōto. In addition, from 1996 to 2002 he was president of Yamaguchi University.

Hironaka was awarded the Fields Medal at the International Congress of Mathematicians in Nice, France, in 1970 for a number of technical results, including the resolution of certain singularities and torus imbeddings with implications in the theory of analytic functions, and complex and Kähler manifolds. Put simply, an algebraic variety is the set of all the solutions of a system of polynomial equations in some number of variables. Nonsingular varieties would be those that may not cross themselves. The problem is whether any variety is equivalent to one that is nonsingular. Zariski had shown earlier that this was true for varieties with dimension up to three. Hironaka showed that it is true for other dimensions.
