# What Was Black College Life Like in the New Deal?

## A photo exhibit exploring life through the lens of Kenneth Space

By U.S. National Archives

Dillard University, Student Body (1936/1937) by Harmon Foundation**U.S. National Archives**

The Great Depression exacerbated the hardships of many African Americans, who already dealt with poverty, segregation, disenfranchisement, and racial violence. In spite of the many social and economic obstacles of the New Deal era, many African American men and women were able to pursue a higher education.

Xavier University, Student Body (1936/1937) by Harmon Foundation**U.S. National Archives**

Thousands of African American students enrolled in what is today known as Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs). These fortunate men and women were considered to be part of the "Talented Tenth" - the elite top 10 percent, members of the race who contributed to racial uplift and combated racism, paving the way for equality for the black community.

From 1936-1937, the Harmon Foundation hired photographer Kenneth Space to capture African American life in the South. Throughout his tour, Space stopped at HBCUs and photographed student life, in and out of class.

The result, presented in this exhibit, depicts a unique reality of the black experience in 1930s America - young adults were members of vibrant social organizations, participated in sporting activities, and worked hard studying for classes.
