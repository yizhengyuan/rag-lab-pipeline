Ancient Indian Architecture  
  
The Science of Architecture and Civil Construction was known in  
  
Ancient India as Sthapatya-Shastra. The word Sthapatya is derived from  
  
the root word Sthapana i.e. 'to establish'. The technique of  
  
architecture was both a science and an art, hence it is also known as  
  
Sthapatya-kala, the word Kala means an art.  
  
From very early times the construction of temples, palaces, rest  
  
houses and other civil construction was undertaken by professional  
  
architects known as Sthapati. Even during the Vedic times, there  
  
existed professionals who specialized in the technique of constructing  
  
chariots and other heavy instruments of war. These professionals have  
  
been referred to in the Rig Veda as Rathakara which literally means  
  
'chariot maker'.  
  
The excavations of the ruins at Mohenjodaro and Harrappa (today in  
  
Pakistan) proved the existence of a developed Urban civilization in  
  
India. The Indus valley civilization is dated around 3000 B.C. Thus  
  
since the last 5000 years. India has had an urban civilization. The  
  
existence of an urban civilization presumes the existence of well  
  
developed techniques of architecture and construction.  
  
These techniques would no doubt have had been systematically stated in  
  
record books for transmitting them to the later generations as well  
  
for being used as reference media for actual construction.  
  
Unfortunately, as far as the Indus Valley civilization goes no such  
  
records have been preserved either as rock edicts, manuscripts, etc.,  
  
or in folk tales and legends.  
  
But the fact that cities on the scale of Mohenjodaro had been  
  
constructed bear testimony to the existence of a systematized and  
  
highly developed technique of architecture 5000 years ago.  
  
But in the later ages, from about the 7th century B.C., we have both  
  
literature references as well as archeological evidences to prove the  
  
existence of large urban civilizations in the Ganges Valley. Like in  
  
most other sciences, even remotely connected with religion, in  
  
architecture also the scientific ideas and techniques have been  
  
integrated with philosophy and theology. This was so as the majority  
  
of the large constructions were temples.

  * ## Mesopotamia And Indus River Valley Similarities

656 Words | 2 Pages

Sumerians, people who settled in Mesopotamia, built city states such as Uruk, Kish, Lagash, Umma and Ur from their government. These city states benefited them in ways for example, being able to grow and trade their food. By trading their goods, Mesopotamia grew as a civilization. The cities were very independent, like mini countries that share the same culture, but had different rulers and their own government. Mesopotamian cities were highly advanced. The Indus River Valley had better city planning, although it was an important part of both civilizations. The Indus River Valley built cities Mohenjo-Daro and Harappa, which were neatly built and made of oven-baked bricks. The Indus River Valley also created the plumbing system which resulted in being able to move forward as a

In the heart of downtown Fort Walton Beach, Florida lies a magnificent hill of earth created by prehistoric Native Americans as a political and religious center.

  * ## Evolution of the Temple-Palaces in Mesopotamia

2263 Words | 5 Pages

The constructions of the temple-palace had large scale implications for the Mesopotamian landscape. It served as a symbolic entity for the city and towns that it was located in due to the tremendous height of these buildings that served as beacons that loomed over villages. These temples were perceived by many individuals who resided in these villages as homes for the deities. A wide cross section of villagers from various social backgrounds belonged to a particular temple in which they would worship. “The temple community comprised a cross section of the population: officials, priests, merchants, craftsmen, food-producers and slaves.” (174 Temple-Palace) Due to the great spiritual investment that was placed within these temples it prompted much time and labor to be invested into their construction. These temples also served as an outlet in which to take care of underprivileged citizens who were poor, orphaned or physically incapable of earning a living. Besides the fact that these temples provided support to the community it also supported the government sector as well. “The activities of the temple coordinated the construction of irrigation canals that often involved the cooperation of several communities.” (174 Temple-Palace) The temple-palace served a variety of integral roles to the villages and cities located within Mesopotamia. Temples intially did not immediately serve all these features within communities in Mesopotamia. Through examining specific periods on the Mesopotamian plain we will further understand how the temple-palaces evolved over the centuries within Mesopotamia and how they eventually became centralized within the community.

  * ##  Greek Architecture

2000 Words | 4 Pages

Throughout history, there have been several significant architectural movements. The last, and perhaps most enduring movement is that of Classic Greece. Although for centuries, the architecture of ancient Greece has been admired, mimicked, and replicated, its beginnings are somewhat surprising to one unfamiliar with the history of the region. It is important to understand the history and mechanics of Classic Greek architecture in order to fully appreciate its form, function, and beauty. “Ancient Greek architects strove for the precision and excellence of workmanship that are the hallmarks of Greek art in general. The formulas they invented as early as the sixth century B.C. have influenced the architecture of the past two millennia” (metmuseum.org).
