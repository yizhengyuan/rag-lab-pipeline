**Süleymaniye Mosque** , grand hilltop structure built in the 16th century on the orders of, and named after, Sultan Süleyman the Magnificent in Istanbul, Turkey. It was designed by Sinan, one of the great architects of his time and architect-in-chief to Süleyman for almost 28 years.

During its construction, more than 3,500 workers laboured on the building. Süleyman sought to use his new mosque to rival the grandeur of the Byzantine-built church Hagia Sophia. The Süleymaniye Mosque is smaller than the Hagia Sophia, but it is arguably a more graceful structure. It measures 194 feet (59 m) long and 190 feet (58 m) wide; the main dome is 174 feet (53 m) high and 89 feet (27 m) in diameter. It has four minarets, and domes descend in tiers from the central dome. In addition to the mosque itself, the complex housed many other structures, including a bathhouse, hospital, public kitchen to feed the poor, and several madrasahs (Islamic schools). In the garden behind the mosque, there are two mausoleums housing the tombs of some important figures, including those of Süleyman and his wife, Roxelana. It also houses the tombs of the sultans Süleyman II and Ahmed II.

In 1660 the mosque was damaged by fire, and it was later restored by Sultan Mehmed IV in a Baroque style, resulting in considerable harm to the original structure. Further destruction occurred during the earthquake of 1766. It was returned to its original style in the 19th century but was damaged again during World War I, when its courtyard was used as a weapons depot and ammunition ignited another major fire. The mosque was not fully restored again until 1956. Further restoration was undertaken between 2007 and 2010, and work on the outer buildings is ongoing.

The Süleymaniye Mosque remains a superb example of the grace and sophistication of architecture at the peak of the Ottoman Empire. The mosque ranks as one of the world’s great buildings.
