**Firozabad district** (Hindustani pronunciation: [fɪɾoːzaːbaːd̪]) is one of the western districts of the Indian state of Uttar Pradesh, which has Firozabad city as its district headquarters. Administratively, the district is a part of the Agra division. 

## History

[edit]

The city lies in the cultural region of Braj and was a part of the Surasena Mahajanapada of aheers during the Vedic Age. It was subsequently ruled by the bigger kingdoms like the Mauryas, Guptas, Scythians, Kushans, Indo-Greeks before falling into the hands of local Rajput ,Aheer and jat rulers. Bhadoria Rajputs from Agra and Jats of Bharatpur and Aheers of gundau, dheerpura,have ruled the city for some time. It was named after Firoz Shah Mansab Dar in 1566 during the reign of Mughal Emperor Akbar. The 1596 gazetteer of Agra and Mathura records that Firozabad was upgraded to a Pargana then given to Nabab Sadulla as a jagir during the reign of Shah jahan (r. 1627–1658). Mr. Peter, a businessman, connected with the East India Company visited the town on 9 August 1632 and found it in good condition. Etawah, Budaun, Mainpuri and Firozabad were all first class mansabdars of the emperor Farrukhsiyar (r. 1713–1719). The estate of Rajput clans the Labhowa Jhala Hindu Rajas were subdued during the Mughal sultanate which captured many regions in the United Provinces, and by 1680 the Rajas of Labhowa lost control of Firozabad district. As written by famous Brithish Historian Matthew Atmore in his book Hindu Tribes and Caste, Jadaun Rajputs are here in huge numbers and other cities of Firozabad. 

[4]

Bajirao Peshwa captured Firozabad and Etmadpur in 1737 in the regime of Mohammad Shah. Jat Rulers from Mahawan attacked Faujdar Hakim Kajim at Firozabad where they killed him on 9 May 1739, then went on to rule Firozabad for 30 years. Firozabad was also part of Bharatpur Kingdom.Gajuddin, Hidayat Vaksh (son of Alamgir II), his nephew and Mirza Baba his son in law, looted Firozabad. Mirza Nabab Khan stayed here until 1782. At the end of 18th century Firozabad was ruled by Himmat Bahadur Gusain with the cooperation of the Raja of Labhowa. 

The French Army Chief Marathas D. Wayan established an ordnance factory in Firozabad in November 1794, an event that Thomas Traving mentions in his book _Travels in India_. Marathas appointed his subadar Lakwadads here who built a fort near the old tehsil. General Lek and General Vellajally attacked Firozabad in 1802. At the beginning of the British regime Firozabad was in the Etawah district and later attached to the Aligarh district. When Sadabad district was created in 1832, Firozabad was made a part of it then later in 1833 the town came under the aegis of Agra district. In 1847 the _lakh_ business flourished in Firozabad.[_clarification needed_]

In 1857, the freedom–fighting Chauhans and Aheers of Mainpuri, the Aheers Jamidar, zamindaar of Chandwar and the local Malahs all took active parts in the Indian Rebellion. Noted Urdu poet Munir Shikohabadi was sentenced to Kala pani by the ruling East India Company. People from this city took part in the Khilafat Movement, the Quit India Movement and the Dandi March with some participants jailed. Mahatma Gandhi visited Firozabad 1929 followed by Semant Gandhi in 1935, Pandit Jawaharlal Nehru in 1937 and Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose in 1940. 

Firozabad district was established on February 4, 1989 by an executive order passed by the Government of Uttar Pradesh. Previously, the areas had been part of Agra district and Mainpuri district.[5]: 3
