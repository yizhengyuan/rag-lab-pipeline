Please check Cambridge.org or https://doi.org/10.1017/s2042169900010221. "Chamberlain's Letters during the reign of Queen Elizabeth." This includes a pedigree of Sir Dudley Carleton in his marriage to "...dau. of ... Skerne of Lincoln," and includes many children, grand children etc, I believe 6 generations.
