The first person to contact the hijacker was Chairman PIA Air Marshal (Retd) Malik Nur Khan who went up to the aircraft and communicated with hijacker through opened cockpit window. The hijacker said that he was suffering from cancer and demanded 10 million Pakistan rupees and 1 million US dollars both in cash for the release of passengers and crew. The hijacker said he needed this money to enjoy last days of his life cut short by cancer. During negotiations Nur Khan told the hijacker that PIA can make arrangements for treating his disease. Nur Khan also offered himself to be kept as hostage in the aircraft in exchange for the release of passengers and crew. The hijacker rejected those offers.

The hijacker set a deadline to blast the aircraft along with hostages by 3:00 PM. The authorities informed the hijacker that banks were closed because it was Friday - a weekly holiday in Pakistan at that time - so it was not possible to arrange cash money demanded by him.

In the evening, the hijacker allowed supply of food and water for hostages in the aircraft. By the start of night time, a total of 14 passengers and an air hostess had been freed by the hijacker. The hijacker released them at different times. The first of them - a woman - was freed around 12:00 PM.

The hijacker sent a message to authorities that he wanted to talk to some important person. In response, Nur Khan accompanied by a Pakistan Army officer came closer to the aircraft. The hijacker allowed Nur Khan to enter the aircraft around 11:50 PM. After nearly an hour of talks, around 12:50 AM Nur Khan attempted to snatch revolver from the hijacker in close confines of F27 cabin. In the ensuing struggle, Nur Khan was shot in the side at point-blank range by the hijacker. By that time, Nur Khan was on top of the hijacker, who was then overpowered by the crew of F27.

Nur Khan is the only Pakistani citizen to have been awarded both these decorations.
