**SS _Olympia_** was a steamship that served the northwest United States and Alaska during the Klondike Gold Rush. She was wrecked in 1910. 

_Olympia_ was laid down as **SS _Doune Castle_** but launched as **SS _Dunbar Castle_** in 1883 by Barclay, Curle and Co. of Glasgow, Scotland, for the Castle Mail Packet Company. In 1895, _Dunbar Castle_ was sold to Fairfield Ship Building and Engineering Co. and renamed SS _Olympia_.[1]

In 1897, the Scottish American Steamship Company bought her, and later that year she was bought by the Northern Pacific Steamship Line. In 1898, she operated with the North America Mail Steamship Company of Tacoma, Washington. In 1903, she operated under the North Western Steam Ship Company of Seattle, Washington, which sold her to the Alaska Steam Ship Company in 1904. That year, lifeboats were installed. 

On 10 December 1910, _Olympia_ ran aground on Bligh Reef off Alaska′s Prince William Sound and sank without loss of life. Following the sinking, steamboat inspectors accused Captain Daniels, in command of _Olympia_ when she ran aground, of "unskillful navigation."[2]
