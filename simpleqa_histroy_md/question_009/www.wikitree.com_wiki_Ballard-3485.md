##  Biography 

Thomas Ballard is shown in the Harleian manuscripts to be the son of Thomas Ballard & Elenor Weston. 

###  Court of Chivalry 

Between 1634 and its temporary abolition by the Long Parliament in 1640 the Court of Chivalry was established on a regular basis for the first time in its history. Evidence survives for 738 of well over a thousand cases that the court processed during this period & they can be found online at University Website. One of those cases involves Thomas Ballard of Wandsworth, co. Surrey, gent in an action against Richard Kestian, a Miller, also of Wandsworth. 

  * Ballard charged Kestian with having said that Ballard lied at Sir Abraham Dawes's house in Putney and in the presence of justices of the peace. Process was granted on 21 June 1637; but no further proceedings survive. 
  * Initial proceedings 
    * 3/176, Fiat 
    * Good Mr Dethick 
    * My Lo: Marshall doth give order that Mr Ballard shall have process against Richard Kestian. 
    * Arundel house 
    * 21 June 1637 
    * Signed by John Coxe. 
  * R.19, fo. 26r, Summary of libel 
    * That I, Ballard, and my Ancestors, is and have bin gentlemen for above 3 [sic] yeares past and soe commonly reputed. And that Kestian at the house of Sir Abraham Dawes at Putney before the kings commissioners or Justices of peace, then said publiquely, that Tho: Ballard did lye, or that, that which I had tould to the commissioners was a lye, or the like in effect, thereby to provoke etc. 
    * Third session, Trinity term, 1637. 
    * No signature. 
  * Summary of proceedings 
    * The cause was set to be examined on 14 October 1637, with Dr Ryves representing Ballard and Dr Duck acting for Kestian, but lines were struck through the cause by the clerk suggesting the cause did not appear. 
  * Notes 
    * Sir Abraham Dawes was a Farmer of the Customs, and one of the wealthiest men of his age 



###  Burial 

  * Date: 14 OCT 1651 
  * Place: Wandsworth, Surrey, England[1]



###  Probate 

  * Date: 04 DEC 1655 
  * Note: The fourth day a commission issued forth to Katherine Ballard, a relict of Thomas Ballard, late of Wandser [Wandsworth] in the County of Surrey (deceased), having goods and to administer the goods, chattels and debts of the said deceased, she being sworne truly to administer. 
    * [In the margin is a note - Hill. 1652][2]



###  Marriage 

The Harleian Manuscripts all name Thomas' wife as Anne & yet the primary evidence shows that her name was Jane. This could be accounted for by a transcription error from the document supplied by Thomas Ballard of Wandsworth in support of his claim to arms being replicated across the remaining folios. 

We know that Jane was baptised in 1597 & thus a marriage in about 1616 would seem likely. 

Thomas' marriage to Katherine Godfrey is estimated as being in 1646 before the baptism of their daughter Katherine on 12th January 1647. 

###  Note 

Through his marriage to Katherine Godfrey Thomas had a connection to the Willoughby family who also had ties with the Hussey's of Sleaford as well as transactions with William Ballard of Wymeswold.[3]. A simple coincidence or is there something deeper here?
