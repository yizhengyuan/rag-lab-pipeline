**Hidegorō Nakano** (Japanese: 中野 秀五郎; 16 May 1909 – 11 March 1974) is a Japanese mathematician,[1] after whom Nakano Spaces are named.[2]

## Life

[edit]

Nakano was born as the first son of Katsugoro Nakano and Kame Nakano, in Tokyo. After graduating from National First High School, a preparatory school for the Imperial University of Tokyo, he progressed to study mathematics in Tokyo Imperial University and graduated with a Bachelor of Science in 1933. Then he entered Graduate School at the same university under the supervision of Takuji Yoshie, and attained his doctoral degree in 1935. At that time, a doctorate was more commonly awarded to people over 50 years old.[3]

Nakano started teaching in The National First High School in 1935. At the same year he married Sumiko Yamamura (11 December 1913, Tokyo - 5 March 1999, Detroit). Then he held academic positions (1938-1952) in Tokyo Imperial University, before moving to Hokkaido University and being appointed as a professor.[4]

In 1960, he left Japan and took a visit to Queen's University in Canada for a year, under the invitation of Canadian Mathematical Congress. He then took up professorship in Wayne State University, Detroit, US, in 1961, and continued working there until his death in 1974.[4]

## Works

[edit]

### Nakano's name in mathematics

[edit]

Nakano is known for his research in Functional Analysis,[5][_original research?_] especially in vector lattice and operator theory in Hilbert spaces. He mainly made his name in his contribution to several mathematical subjects around modulars, Riesz spaces, Orlicz-Nakano spaces and Nakano space.[3]
