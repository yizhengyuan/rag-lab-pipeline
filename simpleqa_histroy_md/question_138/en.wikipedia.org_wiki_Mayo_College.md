**Mayo College** (informally **Mayo**) is a boys-only private boarding school in Ajmer, Rajasthan, India. It was founded in 1875 by the 6th Earl of Mayo, who was the Viceroy of India from 1869 to 1872, making it one of the oldest public boarding schools in India. 

The idea for the college was proposed in 1869 by Colonel Walter. It was founded in 1875 and Colonel Sir Oliver St John became its first principal.[2] The founder intended to create an "Eton of India". The 2nd Baron Lytton, Viceroy of India, said in a speech on campus in 1879: 

    "The idea was well expressed long ago by Colonel Walter in an excellent and most suggestive report which may have influenced Lord Mayo when he founded the present college. In that very sensible report, Colonel Walter pointed out that what was then most needed for the education of India's young rulers and nobles was an Indian Eton. Mayo is India's Eton and you are India's Eton boys".[3]

It aimed to provide the leaders of the princely states with an education similar to that given by Eton College. The British built Mayo for the sons of the Indian upper classes, particularly the princes and nobles of India. Mayo College holds the privilege of educating many members of the Indian Royal Families and also the Royal family of Oman, Said bin Taimur (the 13th Sultan of Muscat and Oman) attended Mayo College from 1922 to 1927 where he mastered English and Urdu. 

## Coat of arms

The coat of arms was composed from the design furnished by Lockwood Kipling, a former principal of the School of Arts, Lahore, and father of Rudyard Kipling. 

In the upper centre of the shield are Mayo Arms and Quarterings, a Lion Rampant and an open hand. On the right and left are the sun and the moon, typical of Suryavanshi and Chandravanshi, the two great families of Rajputs. Below are the Panch Rang, the five sacred colours of the Rajputs, Red, Gold, Blue, White and Green. In the centre is a Rajput fort – two towers connected by a curtain. The supports are on the right: a Bhil warrior with string bow and full quiver of arrows. On the left a Rajput, armed at all points, wearing a steel helmet with three plumes, a shield on his back, a dagger and katar in his belt, and a suit of chain covered with embroidered cloth and gauntlet on his hand.[_citation needed_]

The motto "Let there be Light" is derived from the Bible. The badge is a peacock, the sacred bird of Rajputana, standing on a double-edged, two-handed Rajput sword called Khanda.

College building c. 1895

  * Mayo's first student, H.H. Maharaja Mangal Singh of Alwar, arrived at the school gates in October 1875 on the back of an elephant accompanied by 300 retainers and a menagerie of tigers, camels and horses.
  * One of the school's traditions is meeting for tea on the lawns known as Mughal Gardens immediately after the Annual Prizegiving ceremony. It is believed that M.N. Kapur (who went on to become one of Modern School New Delhi's most respected principals) did away with using a rope to divide English and Indian guests at this ceremony.
  * The Annual Prizegiving, one of the oldest ceremonies at Mayo, has seen chief guests including Lord Irwin, Viceroy of India, Lord Chelmsford, governor general of India, Maharaja Hari Singh, last ruler of Kashmir, Dr. Rajendra Prasad, ex-president of India, Sawai Man Singh II of Jaipur, Gayatri Devi of Jaipur, Vijayalakshmi Pandit, Zakir Hussain, ex-president of India, Karan Singh, Indira Gandhi, ex-prime minister of India, field marshal Sam Manekshaw, Sayyid Faher Bin Taimur of Oman, Birendra Shah, King of Nepal, Khushwant Singh, Madhavrao Scindia, Peter Ustinov, Jaswant Singh and LK Advani.
  * Other traditions at Mayo include an annual horseback parade by the students and sporting fixtures between Old Boys and current students, including a polo match.

Mayo College hosts a variety of prestigious and signature events. These events, spanning diverse domains attract participants and institutions from across India and beyond every year. 

### _The Mayo College Vintage Car Rally_

[edit]

_The Mayo College Vintage Car Rally_ was the _first vintage car rally_ organised by a school in India in 2023. The event brought together the finest vintage car collections and their curators to display over 30 cars within the school grounds. The event was the brainchild of 2 of the school's automobile enthusiasts studying in the 12th grade namely _Aarjav Mehendiratta and Pradyumn Narain Singh_. The boys played a crucial role in reviving the original automobile society established during the period when the legendary J.T.M. Gibson was the principal of the school in 1959. The school's very own Buick Super 8 1947 was displayed by the boys as part of a _unique_ exhibition during the school's _Annual Prize Giving Ceremony in 2022_. 

From there the society was revived with a modern name that Pradyumn and Aarjav came up with, rebranding the society as _"AutoMayo"_. The rally was organised under the guidance of the then principal of Mayo, _Lt. General Surendra Kulkarni_. Many vintage car enthusiasts came from all over India to participate in the event, The event's highlight included a _1929 Stutz Model M_ which was graciously provided by _Mr. Diljeet Titus_. The car had also won the Pebble Beach Concours d' Elegance held in California. Of the event's two organisers, _Pradyumn Narain Singh_ is the younger son of the current[_when?_] ruler of the princely state of Benares _H.H. Dr. Anant Narain Singh_. They also have a vintage car collection spanning over 10 rare and unique cars. 

The event was highly praised and gained worldwide applause from alumni and enthusiasts alike. Cars from princely states like Jodhpur and Udaipur were also there, courtesy of the school alumni namely _H.H. Yuvraj Dr. Lakshayaraj Singh Mewar_ and _Gaj Singh II of Jodhpur_. The event was also graced with the contribution of _Mr. Avijit Badnore_ , alumni of the school and son of _V.P. Singh Badnore_ both of whom are also vintage car enthusiasts. The trophies for the events were made in house at the Technical Skills Centre by the students and featured the school's Buick in a metal casting. Pradyumn and Aarjav were also credited with reviving the automobile magazine _AutoMayo_ , they went on to become _Hockey Captain_ and _Captain Rajasthan House_ respectively. Both of them graduated the school in 2024 with honours. 

### _The Mayo Model G20 Summit_

[edit]

_The Mayo Model G20 Summit_ is a colossal event that brings together the brightest minds from prestigious institutions across the world to address urgent political, social, and economic issues while mastering collaborative diplomacy, innovation, and sustainable solutions. As the leaders of tomorrow, the participants engage in high-level discussions, negotiations, and problem-solving exercises that mirror the actual G20 summit. It has a different theme every year and is a first-of-its-kind event, providing a fully-accurate simulation of the actual G20 Summit in the country with an idiosyncratic format that was formulated without any reference. This event is designed for future leaders who aspire to make a positive impact on the world.
