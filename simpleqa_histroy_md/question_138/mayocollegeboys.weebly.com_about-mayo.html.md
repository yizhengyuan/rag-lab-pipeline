## MAYO HISTORY  
****

**The origin of Mayo College, one of the oldest Public Schools in the country, dates back to 1869, when Lt. Col. F.K.M. Walter, the Political Agent of the Bharatpur Agency recommended a school in India "for a large number of pupils, with a staff thoroughly educated- not mere bookworms, but men fond of field sports and outdoor exercise....". In 1870, Lord Mayo, the then Viceroy and Governor General, came to Ajmer, where in a Darbar, before the Chiefs of the ruling Princes of Rajputana, he expressed his desire to set up a 'Raj Kumar College' in Ajmer, "devoted exclusively to the education of the sons of Chiefs, Princes and leading Thakurs."It is interesting to point out that several generations of the descendents of many present at that darbar have since continued to study at Mayo College.The College was opened in October 1875, with Sir Oliver St. John as the first Principal and one boy, Maharaja Mangal Singh of Alwar.The Main Building was completed in 1885 and was designed by Major Mant.Some of the greatest changes in the school were brought about by Mr. Stow who was the Principal from 1931-1943.In the same year, the Viceroy ceased to be the President of the General Council.This body was in future presided over by a ruling Prince elected by the council.Today, students from all walks of life, study in this prestigious school and make complete use of the many facilities offered here in Mayo College.**

## First House

The construction of the Boarding Houses by the States began independently and the following details will be of interest. The first ten residential houses for boys cost approximately Rs. 4.5 lakh. They contained 112 bedrooms, 17 sitting and dining rooms and could then accommodate 139 students plus the Motamid (House Manager). The cost of land in Ajmer House was paid by British government who also met the cost of college operations- staff, running expenses etc. The rulers of Bundi and Dungarpur subscribed, but did not send any boys for some years, whereas Dholpur, Shahpura and Jaisalmer sent boys but did not subscribe. The Ajmer house was for scions of aristocracy from Ajmer- Merwara district which was a British administrated territory.

## Coat Of Arms

This was composed from the design furnished by Mr. Lockwood Kipling, a former principal of the School Of Arts, Lahore and father of the famous Rudyard Kipling. In the upper center of the shield are Mayo Arms and Quaterings,a Lion Ranpant and an open hand. On the right and left are the Sun and the Moon,typical of Suryawanshi and Chandrawanshi,the two great families of Rajputs. Below are the Panch Ranga,the five sacred colours of the Rajputs,Red,Gold,Blue,White and Green. In the center of which is a Rajput fort-Two Towers connected by a curtain. The supports are on the right, a Bhil warrior with string bow and quiver full of arrows. On the left a Rajput,armed at all points,wearing a steel helmet with three plumes, a shield on his back, a dagger and quatar on his belt, and a suit of chain mail covered with embroidered and gaunlet on his hand. The motto is "Let There Be Light".The badge is a peacock,the sacred bird of rajputana,standing on a two edged, two handed Rajputana Sword Khanda.

## Bharatpur Agency

It is no easy matter to decide what course we ought to pursue in order to ensure to the sons of the aristocracy of this country a liberal and enlightened education, but I think the time has or must shortly come when the government of India must find itself compelled to move in the matter. When the natural guardians are alive, we could of course only earnestly press and urge upon them the desirability of receiving every advantage that education can offer to their children, but whereas in the case of Bharatpur, the government becomes the guardian of the minor I think we ought in future, without fear of consequences on the score of prejudice or misinterpretation of our intentions, to insist open the youth being brought up as gentlemen should be. But to carry this into effect, we must first of all establish an Eton in India. We require a college on an extensive scale, with ample accommodation within its walls for a large number of pupils and the followers(few in number of course) who would accompany them. A complete staff of thoroughly educated gentlemen, not merely bookworms, but men fond of field sports and outdoor exercise, would be necessary, and with these should be associated the elite of the Native gentlemen belonging to the Educational Department. The pupils, or rather their guardians, the tutors, should be allowed ample funds from the coffers of the state to which the minor belonged, and the holidays should be spent in constant travel all over the Continent of India, with an occasional visit to their homes. Many will say that such a scheme is impossible, I admit that it is surrounded with difficulties, but I do not think they are insuperable. If we desire to raise the Chiefs of India to the standard which they must attain to keep pace with the ever advancing spirit of the age, if we wish to make clear to them that our only object is to perpetuate their dynasties, and to make them worthy feudatories of the crown of England, we must place within their sons a better education that they can now possibly obtain. Then, and not till then, we can hope to the native Princes of India occupying the position they ought to hold as the promoters of peace, prosperity and progress amongst their own people, and the hearty supporters of British authority and power." Bharatpur Agency Report - 28th May 1869

## Main Building Architecture 

Several designs were submitted in Grecian, Indo-Saracenic and Kolhapur styles by different engineers. The viceroy finally adopted Major Mant's Indo-Saracenic design in June 1875. The construction began in 1877 and was completed in 1885 at a cost of RS. 3.28 lakhs. Major Mant's design became a classic symbol of Indo-Saracenic architecture and apart from being quoted in architectural courses even today, the design now lies in the archives of the British Museum in London.Mayo College has been called the “Eton Of India” since its founding in 1870 AD. This is best expressed in the words of **Lord Lytton, Viceroy of India** on his visit to Mayo as the Chief Guest on the Annual Prize Giving day on 5th Dec. 1879.“There are I think many points of resemblance between the great Rajput clans and the English houses founded by our northern ancestors. Both of them owe to the same characteristics the positions they have made, and still maintain for themselves in the political hierarchy of an ancient race. Those characteristics are energy, fearlessness, the love of healthful exercise, an instinctive aptitude for active life, an instinctive scorn for all unmanly ease. No race, no class can long maintain its social and moral ascendancy if it degenerates in physical vigor. And it is perhaps a special merit of our English system of education that it aims at training, developing and strengthening not only the mind but also the body. The idea was well expressed long ago by Colonel Walter in an excellent and most suggestive report which may have influenced Lord Mayo when he founded the present college. In that very sensible report Colonel Walter pointed out that what was then most needed for the education of India’s young rulers and nobles was an Indian Eton. Ajmer is India’s Eton and you are India’s Eton boys.”
