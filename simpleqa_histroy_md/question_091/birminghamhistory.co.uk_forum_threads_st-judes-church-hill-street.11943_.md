**St. Jude's. Tonk Street**  
  
Amanda, can you tell us which district Tonk Street is or was. The only St. Judes I know of is near the Albany Hotel, and somewhere on the site is a photograph of that church.

**St Judes Church**  
  
There was also a St Judes Church in Hill St opposite the Midlands Ex Captives Club (home of the Midland Jazz Club in the fifties) St Judes Church was still functioning at this time because I worked on the organ restoration.

That is right, Tonk Street was off Hill Street so it is one and the same St Judes. Consecreated 1846 - demolished 1971.

Sorry to be pedantic, but Tonk St WAS Hill St, not off it. Until about 1887 it was the short stretch between what is now Station Street and Smallbrook St [or Queensway, as it became when it was rebuilt as the accursed Inner Ring Road in the 1960s].  
In about 1961 my dad became organist at St Jude's church and I think he played there until it closed a two or three years later years later.   
As I remember the organ was up in a gallery at the back of the church - I went up there two or three times, but the place was already very much in decline, with the threat of the demolition men .

**St Judes Church**  
  
That would explain why I could not find a Tonk Street on my 1902-11 maps of that area. Very interesting to read that your father was the organist at St Judes. We were putting heating elements in the pipe chambers, one day they waited until I was in the swell organ chamber, when they switched off the light, closed the shutters and started playing the organ. I was not amused.

Is that the car discussed about from the earlier disappeared photo? If so, it's a Jaguar Mk 8 like this one.

Has anyone got any information at all about this church? My great grandparents were married there on 25th December 1891 and I would love to know where it was/is and what is looks like.  
  
Another question......... was it usual to get married on Christmas Day?

Little more on St. Jude's-Hill Street:  
  
_ST. JUDE_ , Birmingham (Hill St.), a building of brick in the Early English style designed by Orford and Nash, and consisting of chancel, nave and aisles, was begun in 1847. (fn. 74) A parish had been assigned out of St. Martin's, Birmingham, and St. Philip's, Birmingham, in 1845. (fn. 75) Services were held in the national school in Pinfold Street until the church was ready; it was consecrated in 1851. (fn. 76) From 1845 the living was a perpetual curacy; it became a vicarage in 1868, and is in the gift of the Crown and the bishop alternately. (fn. 77) The parish was enlarged by a further part of St. Martin's in 1885. (fn. 78) St. Jude's mission hall, Inge St., was licensed for public worship, 1888-1907.

Should have mentioned St. Jude's was demolished in 1971  
  
St. Thomas's only has the tower remaining since it was badly bombed in 1940. Part of the grounds were made into a Peace Garden for the Coronation in 1953.

My Father attended the sunday school at St Judes Church, circa 1888 from when he was 8yrs? old and had a medal inscribed "Never absent, never late, according to the rules of the school", coincidentaly he passed away in 1971 same year that the church was demolished. Len.

I worked in St Jude's Church around 1951 when the organ manuals (keyboards) were being converted from pneumatic to electrical operation. We were installing a heating system in the organ chambers. It was thought a huge joke when one day I was locked in one of the organ chambers, they switched the lights off and started to play the organ.

This view has been on here before, St Jude's in Hill Street (this part used to be Tonk Street) with Smallbrook Queensway visible to the left. It was opposite Hinckley Street, and a 'St Jude's Passage' is now behind the site.

Jules if you go here there is a thread on the forum on the church.  
https://birminghamhistory.co.uk/forum/index.php?posts/488583/  
With more pic's  
  
_NB: Just a tip... Often if you put a "Key Word' in the search box at the top of the page,there may already be a Thread, Posts and Pictures on your request, or subject (e.g. In this case 'Jude') ._  
_The reason being that the forum has been going for many years and has covered many topics during this time. Cheers_
