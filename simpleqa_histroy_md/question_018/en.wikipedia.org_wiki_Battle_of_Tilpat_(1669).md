The **Battle of Tilpat** was fought between Jats and Mughal Subahdars on 12 May 1669. Gokula jat burnt the city of Saidabad near Mathura which caused Mughal commander Abdul Nabi Khan to attack the village of Sūra. Abdul Nabi was wounded and killed. Aurangzeb sent Hassan Ali Khan to fight the rebels. Gokula Jat was captured alive in between the fight and immediately sent to Delhi.[2][3][4]

## Background

[edit]

Aurangzeb imposed the jizya tax on Hindus as a way to spread Islam and end what were seen as non-Muslim customs. He ignored all protests about this tax and was pleased when many Hindus, unable to pay, converted to Islam. Other measures were also put in place to pressure Hindus into converting. For example, in 1665, the customs duty on goods was set lower for Muslim merchants (2%) compared to Hindu merchants (5%), and by 1667, the duty was removed for Muslims but remained for Hindus. The emperor also offered rewards such as government jobs, release from jail, and legal benefits to those who converted to Islam. Hindu religious fairs were banned in 1668, and in 1695, Hindus (except for Rajputs) were forbidden from using palanquins, riding elephants or fine horses, or carrying weapons. These harsh policies led to deep discontent among Hindus, who protested against the attacks on their temples. In some areas, converted mosques were torn down or silenced, and jizya collectors were even attacked and forced to leave. The first major reaction occurred in Mathura in early 1669 when the local Jat peasants, led by Gokla of Tilpat, rose up, killed the Mughal officer 'Abd-un-Nabi, and created chaos in nearby Agra.[5]

In 1669, the emperor Aurangzeb sent a strong army under Radandaz Khan to end a rebellion in the Mathura district and appointed officers such as Saf Shikan Khan and Hasan Ali Khan to control the area. Despite these efforts, the region remained chaotic throughout the year. In September, a peace offer was made to the rebel leader Gokula Jat, stating that if he returned all his stolen goods, he would be pardoned—but this plan failed. By November, the situation had worsened to the point where the emperor had to leave Delhi to address the crisis. On 4 December, Hasan Ali Khan attacked several rebel villages, including Rewarah, Chandar-kaha, and Sarkhud. The villagers fought hard until midday; when they could no longer hold out, many chose to kill their own women and then launched a desperate final attack on the Mughal soldiers. Although the Mughal side suffered significant losses, about 300 rebels were killed and 250 men and women were captured. During this campaign, the emperor also sent 200 horsemen to protect villagers' crops and ensure that his soldiers did not mistreat the local people or take any children.[6][5]

## Battle

[edit]

Hasan Ali Khan, accompanied by his lieutenant Shaikh Razi-ud-din from Bhagalpur defeated Gokla. Gokla's rebel force, estimated at 20,000 strong and mostly composed of Jats and determined peasants, encountered the imperial army about 20 miles from Tilpat. After a long and bloody fight, the rebels, despite their brave charge, were overwhelmed by the superior discipline and artillery of the Mughal forces and fled to Tilpat. The city was besieged for three days before it was finally taken by force. The battle was very costly: around 4,000 Mughal soldiers and 5,000 rebels were killed, and 7,000 people—including Gokla and his family—were captured. Gokla was brutally executed by having his limbs cut off one by one on a public platform in Agra; his family was forced to convert to Islam, and his followers were imprisoned. Meanwhile, innocent people caught up in the fighting were released after proper inquiries, and the elderly and children were handed over to a court eunuch for care.[6][4][2][3][7][8]
