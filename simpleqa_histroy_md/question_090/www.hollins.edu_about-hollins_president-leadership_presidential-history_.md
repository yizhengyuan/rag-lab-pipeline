President Nancy Oliver Gray arrived at Hollins in January 2005.

A new strategic plan,  _Connecting Liberal Arts Education and Experience to Achieve Results_ , focused the university’s efforts through 2016. Hollins completed the largest comprehensive fundraising campaign in school history and the largest ever undertaken by a women’s college in the South, the  _Campaign for Women Who Are Going Places_. The campaign successfully concluded in 2010 with over $161 million raised, far exceeding the goal of $125 million.

Gray also instituted a new major in environmental studies, and a new certificate program in leadership studies. An extensive seminar program was especially designed for first-year students.

  * ### John A. Logan, Jr. 1961 – 1975 

President John Logan was inaugurated on April 14, 1962. He oversaw more campus expansion, including the construction of Tinker Dormitory, Dana Science Building, and the new president’s house. The Hollins College Apartments were also acquired during this time. He also directed development of the first long-range, comprehensive master campus plan, including the moving of Carvins Creek. “The Rock” was dug up during this time and placed near Dana Science Building. The 125th anniversary of Hollins was celebrated during his tenure; the first Hollins Medal is awarded on Founder’s Day as part of the celebration.

Logan also oversaw several academic changes, including the adoption of the “new curriculum”, the establishment of Short Term (J-Term), and independent exam system, the establishment of the Master of Art in liberal studies program, Hollins Abroad-London, and the Horizon program. The first _The Hollins Critic_ was published by the English department, and Frances Niederer’s _Hollins: an Illustrated History_ was also published. Hollins got its first computer during this time.

  * ### John Rutherford “Jack” Everett 1950 – 1960 

President John Everett was inaugurated on April 16, 1951. Campus continued to expand, adding Faculty Row, Turner Hall, Randolph Hall, Fishburn Library (now the Wetherill Visual Arts Center), duPont Chapel, and the Hill Building (now the library annex). As president, he established a progressive new curriculum, the Hollins Abroad-Paris program, and brought the first visiting scholars to campus; he also established new graduate programs in psychology and English. During his tenure, the first career office was initiated, along with the development office and annual fund. He awarded Hollins’ first honorary degree to Mrs. Jessie Ball duPont, member of the Board of Trustees, philanthropist, and namesake of the duPont Chapel. He also oversaw the first Parent’s Day (later known as Family Weekend) and the first literary festival.

  * ### Bessie Carter Randolph 1933 – 1950 

Bessie Carter Randolph’s inaugural ceremony was held on Founder’s Day, February 21, 1934. She was the first Hollins president to receive an inaugural ceremony. She oversaw the centennial celebration in 1942, and encouraged publication of Dorothy Vickery’s  _Hollins College, 1842-1942, an Historical Sketch._

Thanksgiving became a school holiday during her time; prior to this, the students stayed at school during Thanksgiving, marking the day with a basketball game and a feast.

Like her predecessors, Randolph oversaw campus construction and renovation, including Barbee, Tinker Tea House (now Cromer Bergman Alumnae House), and the Art Annex, and initiated the planning of Turner Hall. She established the academic divisions still in use today, those of Humanities, Social Sciences, Natural Sciences, and Fine Arts. The seminar was introduced as a teaching device for seniors.

  * ### Matty Cocke 1901 – 1933 

Martha Louisa Cocke, or “Miss Matty,” as she was affectionately known, assumed the presidency immediately following her father’s death in 1901. With her inauguration, she became the first woman college president in Virginia. She oversaw a massive construction and renovation campaign including: Robbie Burton Alumnae Cottage, Rath Haus, Charles Lewis Cocke Memorial Building, Swannanoa, Rose Hill, Malvern Hill, French House, Pleasants Hall, Duchouquet, Little Theatre, the Gymnasium, Presser Hall, Eastnor, Beale Garden, the power plant, a new sewage system, enlargement of the reservoir on the mountain, and the renovation of Pleasants after a fire in 1925.

Miss Matty also introduced academic changes, offering A.B. and B. music degrees, which replaced the “full graduate” diploma; she established the school of music, eliminated the preparatory department, and established faculty committees, including Freshmen Advising. During her tenure as president, Hollins changed its status from an institute to a college.

  * ### Charles Lewis Cocke 1846 – 1901 

Charles L. Cocke assumed the position of superintendent of Valley Union Seminary, the original name of the university, on July 1, 1846. Although he is honored as the founder of Hollins, he actually took over control of the institute from the Board of Trustees; his leadership of the institute in the following decades allowed Hollins to survive and thrive. During his tenure as superintendent and then president, campus expanded with the construction of several buildings, including East, the Sulphur Springhouse, Main, Bradley, Sandusky, the Parsonage, Carvin, Botetourt, and West.

Cocke also oversaw several academic changes. When Valley Union was first established, it was a coeducational institution. He eliminated the male department, established high academic standards, and set a goal to provide the same training for women as men, a first for women’s education in Virginia. In 1855, John and Ann Hollins donated $5,000 to the school, inspiring its renaming to Hollins Institute. Also during Cocke’s years as president, the Alumnae Association was established, and the first literary magazine and first _Spinster_(yearbook) were published.
