Was born in 1851, and succeeded the late Duke in 1892. He has been a member of the Royal Yacht Squadron since 1878, when as Marquis of Stafford he owned the yawl  _Menai_. This was succeeded by the  _Harelda_ in 1879, and in 1892 by the  _Blue Bell_ , 174-ton schooner, which once was very famous as a racer. After succeeding to the dukedom he became owner of the s.y.  _Catania_ , 668 tons, designed by Mr. G. L. Watson, and built by D. and W. Henderson, of Glasgow, in 1895. In 1901 he owned the 68-ton cutter  _Susan_ , followed by the  _Kriemhilda_ , 106-ton cutter, so famous in the early days of yachting. In addition to being owner of the  _Catania_ , the Duke of Sutherland is part-owner with Mr. Eric Chaplin of the schooner  _Lisette_ , 116 tons, which was designed and built by Hansen in 1873. The Duke and Duchess of Sutherland are devoted to cruising both in home and foreign waters.
