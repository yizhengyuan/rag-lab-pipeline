From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia

English consul and landowner

**Christopher Crowe** (c. 1681 – 9 November 1749) was an English consul and landowner. 

In 1705, aged 24, Crowe was appointed English Consul at Livorno, Grand Duchy of Tuscany.[1] He was awarded the "lucrative" contract to supply the British Mediterranean fleet with wine and olive oil during the War of the Spanish Succession, from 1703 to 1711.[1]

He also worked as a prize agent for captured enemy merchant ships, and acquired artworks on behalf of the English nobility, and grew rich.[1]

In 1707, he bought Woodford Hall, a large house and estate in Woodford, Essex, adjacent to Epping Forest from Sir Richard Child.[2]

In 1715, he married Charlotte Lee, Lady Baltimore who had been married to Benedict Leonard Calvert, 4th Baron Baltimore, and they had five children.[1]

In 1728, he sold Woodford Hall to William Hunt in 1727, having obtained a private act of Parliament, Crowe's Estate Act 1727 (1 Geo. 2. St. 2. c. _8_ Pr.), to do so.[2][3]
