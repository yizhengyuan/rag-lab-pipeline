Beginning early in the 19th century, a number of banks were established in Charles Town. The first came in 1818 after the Bank of the Valley in Virginia was incorporated in Winchester. The bank had established a branch at Charles Town. It’s managers purchased one-half of Lot No. 21 on the southeast corner of West Washington and South Lawrence streets from William Tate, and for the next half century the Charles Town branch of the Bank of the Valley served the citizens of Jefferson County. When in 1871 the U.S. Supreme Court decided that Jefferson County was in West Virginia and not Virginia, the Bank of the Valley closed its Charles Town branch, but Charles Town would not be without a bank for very long.

On March 21, 1871, George Alexander Porterfield posted a notice in the Spirit of Jefferson that “subscribers to the capital stock of the Bank of Charlestown (still one word in 1871)” should meet at “2 o’clock P.M.” on Monday, April 3, 1871, at the bank’s office in the former Bank of the Valley building “for the purpose of organizing, by adopting by-laws, and the election of Directors.” On the first Monday in April 1871, John William Grantham, John Watson McCurdy, Alexander Cramer Timberlake, Moses William Burr, John James Lock, Isaac Henry Strider and Joseph Trapnell were elected directors. In turn, the directors selected John William Grantham to be the bank’s first president. To run the day-to-day bank operations the directors chose George Alexander Porterfield as cashier and his son John Porterfield as teller. 

With its management in place, the Bank of Charlestown was open for business on the corner of Washington and Lawrence Streets, setting in motion an institution which would become a community cornerstone.

Encouraged by three decades of growth, in 1906 the directors of the Bank of Charlestown decided they needed a new building. Although the original structure was satisfactory when first launched, as the bank continued to develop it simply outgrew the space. To accommodate its need for more room, a temporary one-story office suite was built in the vacant lot next door to the bank. Cashier George Porterfield had his office in the new building, a modern safe was installed there, and there was a meeting room set aside for the bank’s directors. In that room the directors decided “to erect a modern bank building on the present site of its directors’ rooms” which would bring all bank operations under one roof.

The Washington, D.C., firm of A.B. Mullett & Company, specialists in the design of government and commercial buildings, was selected to design the new facility. Mullett & Company was familiar with Charles Town because they already had a contract to design another local bank. In addition to planning the new building for the Bank of Charles Town, Mullett & Company had just completed the architectural drawings for the Farmers’ and Merchants’ Deposit Company in Charles Town, located on the southeast corner of George and Washington streets. As fate would have it, both bank buildings designed by Mullett & Co. would eventually have some connection to the Bank of Charles Town.

With plans in hand, bank officials chose the Winchester firm Glaize & Brothers to build the new bank. Optimistically, the Glaize brothers hoped to have the new building ready for occupation before Thanksgiving Day, and construction was underway in the summer of 1907. Just weeks after breaking ground, an advertisement in the Shepherdstown Register invited the public “to inspect our new bank building, which we expect to occupy November 1st.” 

Nov. 1 came and went, and the new bank was still not quite ready for occupation. The newspaper advertisement on Thanksgiving Day remained unchanged and continued the invitation for folks to inspect the new bank building “which we expect to occupy November 1st.” The day after Christmas Day, the message remained unchanged and still invited customers to visit to the new location Nov. 1 now more than six weeks previous. The reason for the delayed opening remains a mystery. 

Mullett’s design incorporated concrete and iron work—was there a delay in procuring material? Did the weather hold things up? Were there critical labor shortages? Whatever the cause, the grand opening of the new building was delayed.

Finally, the Thursday, March 19, 1908, issue of the Shepherdstown Register announced that the Bank of Charles Town “has just moved into its handsome new building and is better prepared than ever to accommodate its patrons. The new building adjoins the old structure on Main Street, and is a handsome edifice of pressed brick, with all modern banking conveniences.” After almost four decades of doing business on the corner of Lawrence and Washington streets, the “popular and stable old institution” was now in operation at 231 West Washington St.

In September 1932, the Farmers and Merchants Deposit Company merged with the Jefferson Bank & Trust Company to form a new bank called the Farmers Bank & Trust Company. The new bank continued to occupy the building on Public Square until it closed in September 1937. George Ward, Banking Commissioner of West Virginia, announced that the Farmers Bank & Trust building would be sold at auction on Saturday, Jan. 15, 1938. Terms of the sale required an initial payment of one-third of the sale price with the remaining balance paid over two years, and that the bank building would be available to its new occupants within ten days following the purchase.

The auction was held in front of the courthouse directly across Washington Street from the bank building. According to the Farmer’s Advocate, the auction “attracted a large crowd, most of them onlookers.” Auctioneer Calvin Preston Engle opened the sale to “spirited” bidding between two bidders—“a group of [unidentified] men” who intended to form a new bank, and the Bank of Charles Town. Cashier W. L. Gibson represented the Bank of Charles Town and made an initial offer of $20,000. The new bank group countered his offer with a bid of $25,000. Bids slowed at that point and increased in increments of $1,000 until Gibson offered what would be the last bid, $40,000. The Bank of Charles Town was moving to Public Square. The Farmer’s Advocate was told that the move would be made “after banking hours one day and will be ready for business at 9 o’clock the next morning in the new location. There will be no interruption to business.” For good reason, an exact date was not given.

Some things never change. What appeared to be a simple process—sale at auction, payment made, property transfer to the new owner—got mired down in the banking bureaucracy. On Abraham Lincoln’s birthday in 1938, the Spirit of Jefferson simply reported “BANK MOVING DELAYED.” The bank’s relocation was postponed “because of a discrepancy in the deed conveying the property from the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation to the Bank.” 

It was too simple for auctioneer “Pres” Engle to hand the deed to Cashier Will Gibson. Instead, the deed first had to travel to Charleston for approval by the State Commissioner of Banking. Once that was granted, the deed was shipped to our Nation’s Capital where it landed on a Treasury official’s desk for the final endorsement. After state and national sanctification, the deed was safely returned to Jefferson County where County Clerk Emily A.M. Stanley dutifully recorded the sale.

Finally! On Feb. 23, 1938, the Spirit of Jefferson announced, “BANK CHAS. TOWN IN NEW LOCATION—Now Utilize Building In Which Farmers Bank Was Operated.” In 1879, Feb. 22 was made a federal holiday to honor the birth of George Washington. In 1938 the general’s birthday was a bank holiday, and Will Gibson decided that was the day that the Bank of Charles Town would move “its records and equipment from its former home on West Washington street to the recently purchased building at the corner of George and Washington streets.” 

How many banks in the United States moved on George Washington’s birthday to a location on the corner of George and Washington streets?

On Monday, Feb. 21, the Bank of Charles Town put the “CLOSED” sign on its door at 231 West Washington St. for the last time. Most of the bank’s records had previously been moved to the new location, which meant that on George Washington’s birthday only “important records” had to be transferred. At 9 o’clock on the morning of Wednesday, Feb. 23, 1938, the “OPEN” sign appeared for the first time on the Bank of Charles Town’s door, now on the corner of George and Washington streets. Within 15 minutes, bank employees “assured callers that they felt perfectly at home.”

For nearly a century, the Bank of Charles Town had been a fixture on Washington Street. Steady growth had prompted the bank to make three moves from its original location on the corner of Lawrence and Washington streets. Its third move to the corner named for General Washington was symbolic of the bank’s position as an institutional leader in Charles Town. The bank’s next move—two doors to the east, still on Washington Street, and in the heart of downtown Charles Town—was affirmation of the bank’s reliability and commitment to the community.

On Tuesday, Jan. 12, 1965, the Bank of Charles Town held its annual stockholders meeting. After electing directors and re-appointing bank staff, the last agenda item was a report from President James W. Strider regarding his search for a new location for the bank. Strider announced the purchase of the Hotel Thomas Jefferson building including its parking lot. The bank took possession of the old hotel on March 1, and prior to that date all the current tenants were ordered to vacate the premises. The hotel’s owners held an auction to sell all of the hotel’s equipment and furnishings, and any remaining items were removed before the property transferred to the bank. The hotel fronted 94 feet on East Washington Street. The back of the lot narrowed to 66 feet on East Congress Street. Although no decision had been made regarding what to do with the hotel building, there was certainly enough room for the growing bank.

By the first of May, the old hotel site was ready for a new building. On May 10, President Strider called a special meeting of the bank’s directors and on May 10 updated them on the plans for the new bank building. First, Strider announced that construction bids had been submitted by four firms, and with a bid of $280,450, Martinsburg contractor W. Harley Miller was selected. Plans called for a two-story brick “colonial type structure with drive-in window” and a “paved parking area to accommodate approximately fifty cars.” The “drive-in” or drive-through window was an innovation, an added convenience for bank customers. 

The new bank would front on East Washington Street. The site of the old hotel included most of the property to the south of or behind the building, which meant that the bank would have possession of all of Lot. No. 54 on the corner of George and Congress streets. As downtown Charles Town grew on street parking on East Washington Street was limited. So, to accommodate its customers, most of the available space behind the new bank would be converted to a new paved parking area. The “drive-in” window was configured so that customers could enter the bank’s parking lot from East Congress Street, approach the window on the east side of the bank building, and after completing their transaction, exit onto East Washington Street. It is interesting to note that the original configuration for the drive-through window is the same today for both drive-through windows and the ATM.

For the last time, on Friday, May 5, 1967, President James W. Strider put the “Closed” sign on the door of the bank on the corner of George and Washington streets. The new and modern facility was ready for occupation, and the bank’s valuables were moved over the weekend. Strider was quoted as saying “the new bank has been built to give the fastest, most efficient and convenient service possible to the people of our banking area.” Executive Vice President Donald S. Smith chaired the building program, and he issued an invitation to the general public to take advantage of the bank’s new and enlarged parking lot, the new “drive-in” window, and the addition of several tellers—each of which would make patronage at the bank more pleasant.

On Monday, May 8, at 9 a.m., President Strider stood on the top step of the new bank’s entrance and addressed a crowd of over a 100 people who gathered for the bank’s grand opening. Pastor Richard Neal of St. James Lutheran Church offered a prayer of dedication for the new bank. Strider then thanked several people involved in the building project including architect Ferdinand P. Kelly from Baltimore, Martinsburg contractor W. Harley Miller, and interior decorators Koch and Associates. Strider also reminded everyone in attendance that “the success of the bank was due to the continued support of its loyal depositors.” 

In a fitting tribute, Mary McDonald Porterfield presented President Strider with a silver dollar minted in 1871, the year that the Bank of Charles Town was incorporated. Loyal depositors played a huge role in the bank’s success, but the leadership provided by three generations of Porterfields and Striders provided guidance for the bank through times good and bad. Strider then turned to Charles Town’s Mayor Nicholas Carson, handed Carson a pair of scissors, and with a snip the mayor severed the ribbon made of one-dollar bills. At its new location—111 East Washington St.—the Bank of Charles Town was now open for business.

Here in Jefferson County, you can count on one hand the number of companies which have remained open for business for one 150 years. Two fingers represent the number of banks which have celebrated a sesquicentennial. In addition to the Bank of Charles Town, another hometown bank, Jefferson Security Bank in Shepherdstown, also recently celebrated 150 years of successful banking. Good fortune can account for a small portion of that longevity, but a tried-and-true recipe for sustained success combines a generous helping of sound leadership and a dedicated staff. When added to an equal portion of community service, this combination creates a bank which is rooted in tradition and is committed to growing the community.
