### Biographical Note

Leo Strauss was born on September 20, 1899, in Kirchhain, Hesse, Germany, to Hugo Strauss and Jennie David, owners of a small agricultural business. He graduated from the Gymnasium Philippinum in 1917, then served in the German army through the end of World War I. 

Following the war, Strauss studied philosophy in Marburg, Frankfurt, Berlin and Hamburg, receiving a PhD in 1921 from Hamburg University for his dissertation "Das Erkenntnisproblem in der philosophischen Lehre Jacobis." He continued his studies, with a focus on history, in Freiburg, Giessen and Marburg. Publication of the essay "Cohens Analyse der Bibelwissenschaft Spinozas" in 1924 led to his 1925 appointment to Berlin's Academy of Jewish Research, where his research on Jewish philosophy formed the basis of his first major work, Die Religionskritik Spinozas als Grundlage seiner Bibelwissenschaft (1930). Strauss also translated Moses Mendelssohn's work from the Hebrew for the Academy's Mendelssohn Edition. In Berlin, Strauss met several scholars with whom he began long and substantive correspondence. Among them were Alexandre Kojeve, Karl Löwith, Hans-Georg Gadamer, Jacob Klein and Gershom Scholem. 

In 1932, Strauss was awarded a Rockefeller Fellowship in the social sciences, with the aid of which he studied medieval Jewish and Islamic philosophy in Paris and Thomas Hobbes in England. Unable to return to pre-war Germany, he continued his work on Hobbes at Sidney Sussex College, Cambridge, publishing The Political Philosophy of Hobbes: Its Genesis in 1936. In 1937, he emigrated to the United States, first taking an appointment as Research Fellow in the Department of History at Columbia University, then a professorship at the New School for Social Research, where he remained until 1948. Strauss served as associate editor of Social Research from 1941 to 1948. 

Strauss became Professor of political philosophy at the University of Chicago in 1949. He remained at Chicago until 1968, and was named Robert Maynard Hutchins Distinguished Service Professor in 1960. Natural Rights and History (1953) was based on lectures delivered at the University in 1949. An effort by Strauss and other faculty to establish a chair in Jewish Studies was unsuccessful. 

Strauss served as visiting professor at the University of California at Berkeley in 1953. In the early 1950s, he corresponded with Martin Buber about a chair in sociology at the Hebrew University in Jerusalem. He taught in Jerusalem as a visiting professor in 1954 and 1955, but chose to remain at the University of Chicago. Lectures delivered in Jerusalem were the basis for the title essay of Strauss' What is Political Philosophy? (1959). 

In 1965, following the translation of many of his works into German, Strauss was awarded an honorary doctorate in Economy and Social Science by the University of Hamburg. From 1965 until his death, he was the Scott Buchanan Distinguished Scholar in residence at St. John's College in Annapolis, Maryland. During his later years, he worked mainly on interpretation of ancient Greek philosophers. His last major work, The Argument and Action of Plato's "Laws" was published posthumously in 1975. 

Strauss married Marie (Mirjam) Bernson on June 20, 1933. The couple raised two children, Thomas (Petri), Bernson's son from her first marriage, and Jenny Ann Kraus, the orphaned daughter of Strauss' sister, adopted by the Strauss' in 1946. Other members of Strauss' immediate family died in a German concentration camp in 1942. Strauss became an American citizen in 1938. He died in Annapolis, Maryland on October 18, 1973. 

Leo Strauss is known mainly for five books, each of which has been widely translated and regularly reprinted: Die Religionskritik Spinozas (1930), The Political Philosophy of Hobbes (1936), On Tyranny (1948), Natural Right and History (1953) and Thoughts on Machiavelli (1958). While much of Strauss' writing is known mainly to scholars, On Tyranny and Natural Right and History deal with more general issues of political philosophy in a public context. On Tyranny wrestles with the ethical problems of dictatorship, as reflected in Xenophon's Hiero. Natural Right and History, closely related to Strauss' study of Hobbes in the 1930s, deals broadly with the philosophical and historical problems of the liberal state, brought to the forefront of Western consciousness by political events of the 1930s and World War II. 

Strauss' five major works demonstrate the intertwining themes on which Strauss focused throughout his career. In a letter to Dr. Cyrus Adler (November 30, 1933) he described the genesis of his related interests: 

My studies of Spinoza's Theological and Political Treatise have shown me a connection between the theological and political problem. These studies have led me to Spinoza's Jewish medieval predecessors, especially Maimonides, on the one hand, and Hobbes' political science on the other hand. During the pursuit of these sources, I formed the plan to make 1. the political science of Hobbes and 2. the theory of prophecy in Jewish and Islamic philosophy of the Middle Ages the subject of my future studies…. After finishing my book on Spinoza, I was charged by the Akademie to analyze Gersonides' Milchamot Hashem. I started with an analysis of Gersonides' Teaching on Prophecy. The research on his sources led me from Maimonides to Islamic philosophers, of whom I studied several in Arabic manuscripts – and made me realize that the connection between medieval Jewish and Islamic teaching on prophecy and Plato's Statesman and Laws had not yet been thoroughly evaluated. 

Though Strauss maintained a deep interest in Jewish religious thought and philosophy, his study of Jewish thinkers culminates with his writings on Spinoza in the 1930s. He was particularly sensitive to the legacy of medieval Jewish thought, which he saw as essential to understanding developments in later European thought. He concerned himself also with contemporary perceptions of Spinoza and with the image of the Jew in German literature of the Enlightenment. 

Strauss believed that the roots of Western Civilization could be found in Jewish and Greek philosophy. His early classical humanistic education included extensive study of Latin and ancient Greek, and his later studies of philosophy broadened his knowledge of classical languages and deepened his appreciation of the humanistic method of tracing concepts and beliefs to their roots in primary material. After 1960, Strauss turned increasingly toward the study of Greek philosophy. 

### Scope Note

The Leo Strauss Papers have been divided into eight series: Series I, Correspondence; Series II, Teaching; Series III, Manuscripts; Series IV, Publications and Reviews; Series V, Personal Files ; Series VI, Oversize; Series VII, Audio Recordings and Series VIII, Restricted Files. The collection spans the years 1930 to 1997, with the bulk dating from the 1930s through the 1960s. Photocopies of some of Strauss' writings from the 1920s are also included. 

Series I contains approximately 1000 letters. Strauss' correspondents include friends, students, publishers, academic officials and colleagues. Letters are written German, English and French. 

Correspondence from Strauss' colleagues generally concerns ongoing scholarship. Letters often focus on particular themes or problems, as in Erich Voegelin's discussion of "das Verhaltnis von Wissenschaft und Offerbarung." (April 22, 1951) Other colleagues give detailed analyses of Strauss' writings. See, for example, letters from Hans-Georg Gadamer. 

Strauss formed many long-lasting intellectual and personal ties to fellow scholars. Many of these relationships are reflected in correspondences that span several decades and show the ups and downs of long friendships. The noted scholar and educator Jacob Klein, for example, analyzed Strauss' personality in a letter of December 1, 1932, while Strauss characterized Klein in his "Unspoken Prologue." A spirited and amusing friendship is reflected in letters from Peter von Blanckenhagen, which contain poems and scholarly humor. Another sort of relationship may be found in Strauss' correspondence with Julius Guttman, Strauss' superior at the Academy of Jewish Research in Berlin. Strauss held Guttman in high esteem, but his work failed to win Guttman's full approval. 

Correspondence from the 1930s and 1940s contains surprisingly little comment regarding political affairs in Germany. An exception is Jacob Klein's lengthy description of the local situation in a letter from June 20, 1934. After the war, Strauss corresponded regularly with German academics and with German publishers interested in his writings. A letter from the philosopher Hans-Georg Gadamer (December 16, 1948) expresses grief and shame over the crimes of the Third Reich. 

Series II, Teaching, includes manuscripts of Strauss' lectures and essays and numerous groups of reading notes on subjects on which he wrote and taught. Although many of Strauss' publications were based on his lectures, the collection does not seem to include texts directly related to his most well-known books and articles. 

Strauss' notes are largely organized by subject. They have been organized into four groups, reflecting major themes in Strauss' thought and work. The first group comprises notes on Hobbes and Natural Right. Strauss did most of his research on Hobbes in England in the early 1930s. His work led to the publication of The Political Philosophy of Hobbes: Its Basis and Genesis (1936), the German manuscript of which is in Series IV. Notes found in Series II are likely to have been used for this book as well as for occasional lectures and articles. Also included are notes related to Strauss' interest in editing Hobbes' unpublished letters. 

The second group of notes concerns Jewish thought. Among the major thinkers appearing in Strauss notes are: 

Averroes (Ibn Rushd) (Roschd), 1126-1198, a Mohammedan of noble birth. His commentary on Aristotle was one of the most widely read texts of the Middle Ages. He is often known as "the Commentator." 

Rabbi Moses ben Maimon (Maimonides) (FMbM), 1134-1204, author of the Mishneh Torah (1180) and the Guide of the Perplexed (1190). His work profoundly influenced Thomas Aquinas and Albertus Magnus. 

Rabbi Lewy ben Gerson (Gerschom) (Gersonides) (RLbG), 1288-1344, defended Averroes' Commentaries against later critics. His most important work is Milchamot Hashem, translated into German in the sixteenth century as Die Kampfe Gottes. 

Hermann Cohen, 1842-1918, founded the Marburg school of Neo-Kantianism and taught at the Academy for Jewish Research. 

A third group of notes comments extensively on books read by Strauss in the original Greek. Strauss was extremely well-versed in classical languages, and others often sought his advice on the subject. Many of the major research themes of the field are discussed in his correspondence, particularly with Karl Löwith, Jacob Klein, Joseph Cropsey and Seth Benardete, and reflected in his notes. A final group of notes covers a range of subjects outside the major categories discussed above. 

Series III, Manuscripts, and Series IV, Publications and Reviews include manuscript, typescript and published texts of many of Strauss' writings. A small amount of correspondence with colleagues and publishers is included with the texts. Series IV contains proof sheets for several of Strauss' books. Also included in Series IV are a small number of writings by other scholars, collected by Strauss, and also review articles and newspaper clippings concerning his work. 

Series V, Personal, contains a small number of biographical documents and several honors and awards received by Strauss. It also includes a brief diary kept by Strauss in 1944. 

Series VII, Audio-Visual, contains audio recordings of Strauss lectures, primarily from the 1960s. The recordings are arranged chronologically. Subseries 1 contains original and new master copies. These are not available for listening. Subseries 2 contains access copies of many of the recordings, on audio cassette. These are available for listening onsite. Items from Subseries 1, for which access copies are not available in Subseries 2, may be eligible for reproduction. Please see Special Collections Research Center staff for further information. 

Series VIII, Restricted, contains letters of recommendation written by Strauss, and correspondence with Gershom Scholem, to which access is restricted.

### Series II: Teaching  
  
---  
  
Series II contains material related to Strauss' teaching and research and is divided into three subseries: 1, Lectures; 2, Essays; 3, Notes.

Subseries 1 and 2 contain texts of many of Strauss' lectures and essays. Many of these are hand-written in bound notebooks and some are given only in brief outline. Because the texts are not always clearly dated or labeled, the distinction between lectures and essays is sometimes unclear. 

Subseries 3 consists of research and writing notes. Strauss organized his research material by subject. Many are on small scraps of paper, and most are handwritten. They are organized into three Sub-subseries: 1, Hobbes, Natural Right; 2, Jewish Thought; 3, Greek Thought and 4, Miscellaneous.
